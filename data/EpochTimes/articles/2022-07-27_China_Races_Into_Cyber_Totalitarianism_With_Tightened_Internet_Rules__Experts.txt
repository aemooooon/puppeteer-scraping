The new regulations refine the regime’s firm grip on personal data and livelihood, and the operations of private enterprises.
Beijing’s latest regulations acquire full disclosure and certification of personal information for internet users during registration, and clearance of data export via the governmental agencies, reportedly for the sake of national interest and security.
However, what lies behind the rule is the CCP’s fear.
For instance, data handlers with cumulative personal information of more than 100,000 people or the sensitive personal information of more than 10,000 people should apply for the security assessment.
The regulation also requires all outbound transfers of important data to seek assessment by the government agency.
Tang explained that the policy will force multinational companies to adjust their IT platforms and internal organizational structures. Companies may be forced to comply with self-censorship to save themselves the trouble, and to ultimately  localize inside China.
This would amount to unfair competition, and conflict in the free flow of data for multinational corporations. It may force foreign companies to leave China, Tang said.
