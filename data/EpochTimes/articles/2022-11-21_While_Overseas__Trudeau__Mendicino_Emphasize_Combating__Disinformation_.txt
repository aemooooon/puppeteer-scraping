During their overseas trips this week, both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino put a spotlight on the issue of “disinformation,” emphasizing Canada’s focus on the issue on the international stage.
“Taking a leading role at the G7, Canada has invited counterpart interior and public safety ministers here for a summit to tackle disinformation, which is one of the most pervasive threats to all our democracies right now,” he wrote.
A summit in Canada would serve as a way to “flip the script, and to get ahead of the curve of disinformation,” he said.
“This is where we think that Canada and the G7 can show leadership.”
Mendicino said the “marketplace for disinformation” is much greater than the “marketplace for reliable information” and that Canadians need help to determine which is which.
Trudeau said Canada “is leading on the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence.” He repeated Mendicino’s comment about big technology companies, saying they have a responsibility to “address online harassment and violence to ensure trust in technology.”
“While always ensuring and defending free speech, we must make it clear that it cannot be OK to bully and attack people online,” the prime minister said.
