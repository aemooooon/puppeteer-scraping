In dissecting FTX’s collapse, it’s crucial to appreciate what too few people, woefully uneducated in economic truths thanks to a union-dominated public school system, know about company valuation—that what observers accept to be a firm’s worth is always dependent on human judgment that presumes trustworthy conduct. Was Blockbuster Video worth $8.4 billion when Sumner Redstone bought it for that price in 1994? Had he known that some 16 years later, as consumers became able to “rent” movies with a click of their remotes, that Blockbuster would be a corporate dinosaur filing for bankruptcy, Redstone likely would’ve considered investing those billions of dollars elsewhere. But no one at Blockbuster knew it was headed off a cliff.
Perhaps only a one-time adolescent math whiz absent of moral scruples could possess the technical skills and lack of ethics required to pull off shifting his customers’ money back and forth between various affiliated business entities in a shell game that included using new loans to pay interest on old loans in order to present the fiction of liquidity, with celebrities such as quarterback Tom Brady and TV actor Larry David enlisted to enhance FTX’s public image. Bankman-Fried even got FTX’s logo on the uniforms of all of Major League Baseball’s umpires, juxtaposing the Nike swoosh adorning those of the players. After flying so high, the firm—once thought to be worth $32 billion—is now under federal investigation for securities violations.
In the cases of both FTX and Theranos, unwitting investors’ cash didn’t all go down the black hole of Bankman-Fried’s and Holmes’s lies; they financed left-wing candidates and causes that the owners of that money didn’t approve—and no doubt many oppose. And Democrats seem none too happy to take money invested under false pretenses.
