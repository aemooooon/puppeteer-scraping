The FBI has identified China as the greatest intelligence threat to the United States. The Chinese regime employs a variety of methods to infiltrate U.S. companies and the government in order to support Beijing’s interests, to control dissenters, and to steal U.S. technology and know-how.
The following are just a few examples of cyberattacks that were allegedly carried out by Chinese hackers with ties to Beijing.
In 2015, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was breached, with Beijing-linked hackers stealing information on 20 million current and former federal employees.
In 2013, Chinese hackers penetrated both The New York Times and the Journal.
Similarly, in October 2019, Beijing threatened to cut lucrative contracts with the NBA’s Houston Rockets when its general manager, Daryl Morey, “liked” a social media post by Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.
In these cases of industrial espionage, the CSIS reported that 42 percent of the alleged perpetrators were Chinese military or government employees, 32 percent were private Chinese citizens, and 26 percent were non-Chinese, usually Americans, who were persuaded to act on behalf of the CCP. The prevalence of economic spying has increased over the past decade, with 76 percent of these incidents occurring between 2010 and 2021, according to the report.
The CCP often makes strategic investments in American companies in order to gain access to proprietary information. In some cases, the true ownership of a state-owned or state-controlled company may be obscured.
