Every cancer diagnosis comes with a range of reactions, including the natural inclination to act as quickly as possible to choose and begin treatment.
There are several possible explanations for this finding. The median PSA was relatively low among randomized patients; most of the trial patients were at low risk or favorable intermediate risk and would today be considered appropriate candidates for active surveillance.
Another possibility is that, in most cases, prostate cancer is a slow-growing cancer and may not necessarily lead to death if left untreated for some time.
Notably, patients who received radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiotherapy were more likely to experience adverse effects, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, than those on active monitoring.
Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that active monitoring could be appropriate for some men with localized prostate cancer, particularly those with low-risk disease. This approach involves regular monitoring of the cancer with PSA tests and other diagnostic measures, with treatment initiated only if the cancer shows signs of progression.
Overall, the current study findings highlight the importance of balancing the potential benefits and harms of prostate cancer treatments.
The ProtecT trial relied on PSA testing, which, though still a standard test, is “no longer the norm,” writes Sartor.
Active monitoring, also known as active surveillance, is a management approach for prostate cancer. Patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease are closely monitored with regular PSA testing, prostate exams, and sometimes repeat biopsies but don’t receive immediate active treatment such as surgery or radiation.
It aims to avoid overtreatment and its potential side effects in patients who may never develop symptoms or die from cancer while providing timely treatment if cancer shows signs of progression.
Methods used for active surveillance have evolved over the past two decades, with new evidence and guidelines informing the approach. For example, MRI and targeted biopsy have become more common in recent years, allowing for more accurate tumor size and location assessment and reducing the need for repeat biopsies. Additionally, some risk-stratification systems have been developed specifically for active surveillance patients, considering factors such as age, PSA level, and biopsy results to identify patients who may be good candidates for this approach.
Active surveillance is not appropriate for all prostate cancer patients and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Patients with higher-risk diseases or who are uncomfortable with close monitoring without active treatment may opt for more aggressive treatment options such as surgery or radiation.
Men with localized prostate cancer shouldn’t rush their treatment choices or react with fear, according to lead ProtecT author Dr. Freddie Hamdy of the University of Oxford. Instead, they should “consider the possible benefits and harms caused by the treatment options.”
This may apply to other cancers as well.
