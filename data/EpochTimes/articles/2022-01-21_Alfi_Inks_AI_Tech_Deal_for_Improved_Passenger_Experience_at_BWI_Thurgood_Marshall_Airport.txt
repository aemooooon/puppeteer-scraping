ALFI Inc. announced an agreement Thursday with Slice Wireless Solutions Inc. to begin installations of targeted artificial intelligence digital advertising technology in multiple kiosks located within the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.
Digital technologies such as these AI kiosks can create a more unique, engaging experience than traditional “advertising only” channels, as digital kiosk advertising has been proliferating in densely populated areas such as airports, according to the announcement.
BWI Marshall Airport caters to 25 million-40 million passengers annually.
