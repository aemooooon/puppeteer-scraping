But is it true that decoding genes reveals the secrets of how humans are created by God?
Even though the number of proteins may vary from different sources, it is universally agreed that a gap exists between the number of genes and proteins.
This is one of the most shocking findings of the human genome project. Researchers immediately realized that the hypothesis “one gene, one protein” was inaccurate and began looking for the mechanisms.
Here’s one possible answer.
Who controls immune cells to change gene splicing and its end product?
Let’s talk about another example—transgenic animals.
If the gene is responsible for a disease, fixing the gene should cure the patient. However, drugs that work in transgenic models may not produce the expected efficacy in humans.
Our moods aren’t solely influenced by genetics, but also by our cumulative environmental experiences throughout adulthood.
Genes can be compared to seeds, whereas epigenetics is like the soil in which those seeds grow.
Genes in the human body do not usually change after birth. But like “seeds” they can lie dormant in the soil; some will grow, and some will not. What determines whether these seeds will grow or not are the genetic “switches” or “epigenetics.”
Our body is like a small universe. Once we realize we have a disease, many things have already changed.
The complexity of the association between genes and disease is reflected in the large number of genes involved, leading to the question of who controls their interactions.
Nowadays, molecular biologists can even use gene therapy to repair mutated genes with molecular scissors.
However, these medical practices come at a cost.
Replacing the heart with a new heart creates new complications. Taking drugs may relieve symptoms while creating new ones.
This is the same feeling of awe and wonder for scientists investigating life. As they delve deeper, they discover more layers of complexity—from organs to cells, cells to proteins, proteins to genes, and genes to epigenetics. No matter how much they learn, there will always be another layer of truth about life waiting to be discovered.
“Beyond each structure, accessible to the investigation, another structure of a higher order is revealed. ... Each level of the organization thus brought to light leads to a new way of considering the formation of living beings.”
The human body is remarkable. From the self-repair mechanisms of our genes to the intricate dance of our cells and organs, every aspect of our biology speaks to a designer who carefully crafted us to thrive in our environment.
Let’s also not forget the interconnectedness of body, mind, and spirit, which extends beyond genetic control.
Given its complexity and beauty, the human body is more than just a random assemblage of genes, cells, and molecules.
