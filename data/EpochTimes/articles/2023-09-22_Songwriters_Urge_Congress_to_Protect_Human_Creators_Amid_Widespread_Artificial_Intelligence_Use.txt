Award-winning songwriters and composers are set to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Sept. 21 to discuss protecting the rights of music creators amid a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
About 30 members of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), a membership association of more than 935,000 songwriters, composers, and music publishers, will meet with lawmakers, the organization announced on Wednesday.
They include songwriters Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who have penned songs for singers including Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson, and pop songwriter Madison Love, who has written music for artists including Ava Max and Pink.
“Artificial intelligence is moving at the speed of light and we need lawmakers to act now,” said ASCAP CEO Elizabeth Matthew in a statement. “We fully embrace innovation but only innovation coupled with regulation that protects the rights of creators.”
Earlier on Sept. 20, ASCAP hosted a “We Write the Songs” concert at the Library of Congress.
“True music comes from deep within our souls; it’s human-first, heart songs, revealing and often healing our human condition,” said Paul Williams, president and chairman of the board of ASCAP, in the announcement. “Now we need Congress to put humans first, stand with songwriters, and protect our rights to our own musical works. Don’t give them away to AI.”
The ASCAP meeting with lawmakers comes amid negotiations between striking screenwriters and Hollywood studios, which have put a halt to film and television productions. Screenwriters have also raised concerns over the use of AI in scriptwriting, along with issues regarding pay and increased rights.
During the forum, leaders and lawmakers discussed the risks and benefits associated with the technology amid its increasingly widespread use, as well as how Congress can best move forward in implementing safeguards for the development of AI.
