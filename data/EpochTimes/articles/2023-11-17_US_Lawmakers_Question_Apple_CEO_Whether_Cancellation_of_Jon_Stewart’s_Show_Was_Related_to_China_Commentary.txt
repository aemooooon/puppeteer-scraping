House of Representative members leading a special committee questioned Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday concerning the tech company’s choice to cancel Jon Stewart’s Apple TV+ talk show because the host was planning a segment on China.
“It also highlights an additional reason, beyond the traditionally cited national security rationales, why we encourage Apple to accelerate its efforts to reduce its dependence on the PRC in its core business,” it said, referring to China’s official name, People’s Republic of China.
“The Problem With Jon Stewart” debuted in 2021 on Apple TV+ as part of a multiyear first-look deal Mr. Stewart signed with Apple. The one-hour series addressed a topic in each episode, with each topic related to current national events or Mr. Stewart’s advocacy work. Topics included climate change, globalization, gun control, incarceration, racism, and the media.
