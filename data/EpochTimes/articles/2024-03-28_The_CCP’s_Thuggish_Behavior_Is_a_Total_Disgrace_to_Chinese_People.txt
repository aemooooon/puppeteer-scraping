March 25 was a special day.
These announcements are rare statements that expose the thuggish acts of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the whole world.
Since its establishment in 2006, Shen Yun has awed millions of audience members around the world with authentic Chinese history and tradition, dating back to before communism, while also exposing onstage the ugly nature of the CCP.
Shen Yun has been lauded by theatergoers for its pure performances and outstanding artistic excellence, winning numerous accolades worldwide. The show frequently attracts full houses and reaches more than 1 million audience members every year.
The CCP sabotages Shen Yun because it is afraid of its efforts to revive traditional Chinese culture; of the world getting to know China before communism; and of the world becoming aware of the Party’s evil nature.
The CCP’s evil traits have persisted since it seized power in China in 1949. It has been ruling China through violence and totalitarianism, permeating all facets of society, and extending its influence abroad.
The CCP rapidly enacted Article 23 in Hong Kong, a new sweeping national security law, which has triggered a fresh wave of global condemnation and protests.
In addition, the CCP is consistently colluding with nefarious regimes around the globe, providing overt and covert support to a range of terrorist groups, and undermining and challenging the democratic systems of the West.
In the realm of technology, it steals it on a global scale and then replicates it in China, attempting to leapfrog Western countries. Tactics used by the CCP include economic warfare and an all-out spy war, bringing total disgrace to Chinese and foreign academics.
The CCP’s actions have incited the ire of the international community, leading to a concerted effort to contain it.
Between 2018 and 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice brought charges against more than 150 academics, about 90 percent of whom were of Chinese origin or descent.
Ms. You and her Chinese corporate partner, Weihai Jinhong Group, received millions of dollars in grants from the CCP to support the new company, prosecutors said.
Mr. Ding was charged with four counts of trade secret theft, each punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He was arrested at his residence in Newark, California, on March 6.
The 38-year-old allegedly stole more than 500 files containing confidential information between May 2022 and May 2023.
The CCP’s intellectual property theft has actually jeopardized the reputation of the Chinese diaspora, particularly affecting the career prospects of scientists of Chinese origin. The CCP’s systematic appropriation of U.S. and European technology has resulted in widespread suspicion of overseas Chinese as potential CCP collaborators or even proxies, impeding their opportunities for advancement abroad.
For instance, in the past few years, the United States has denied entry to hundreds of Chinese academics and international students, while others have faced expedited deportation.
Recently in Australia, two Chinese individuals used Uber to visit a luxury store in Sydney. During the ride, the driver inquired, “Are you heading to the store to take photos so you can replicate and sell knock-offs?”
The CCP has moralized, normalized, rationalized, and even militarized acts of intellectual theft, waging what it dubs a “people’s war” to appropriate advanced Western technologies under the guise of patriotism, nationalistic fervor, and the promise of monetary and reputational rewards. This alarming and aberrant conduct is without historical precedent.
The CCP’s thuggish behavior extends beyond the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. In Africa, the CCP is aggressively expanding its influence without regard for the consequences, resulting in severe ecological damage, rampant poaching of wildlife, and the oppression of local populations.
At that time, people from diverse backgrounds flocked to China to acquire knowledge and expertise, symbolizing the splendor of Chinese civilization. Even the children dispatched beyond the nation’s borders during the Qing Dynasty to study in the United States largely assimilated swiftly into U.S. society and forged numerous friendships.
Nevertheless, under the deliberate influence of the CCP, many Chinese individuals today demonstrate behavior and a mindset that diverges from the international community. The prevalent traits include disregard for norms, distrust, lying, inclination toward confrontation, and an aversion to admitting faults while prioritizing personal image. The uncivilized conduct of numerous Chinese immigrants in Western societies has left the international community aghast.
In 2015, a Chinese woman allowed a young boy to defecate outside a Burberry store in the village of Bicester, England, though a public bathroom sat only feet away.
In 2016, a Chinese tourist shocked Russians when she allowed her child to urinate directly on the floor of the grand Catherine Palace. Built in the 18th century, the palace was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990.
Throughout its decades in power, the CCP has consistently stooped so low and committed such contemptible deeds, earning the condemnation of nations worldwide and tarnishing the reputation of both China and its people. When the CCP faces opposition from free societies, it shamelessly uses the Chinese people as its shield.
A community that neglects civilized etiquette will not garner respect; a regime that disregards integrity will not sustain itself; a nation and a people without cultural roots cannot genuinely thrive. Chinese citizens and members of the international Chinese community should recognize the CCP’s harm and destruction of China’s reputation and the image of its people. By resisting the misconduct of the CCP, they can safeguard the reputation that the Chinese people rightfully deserve.
