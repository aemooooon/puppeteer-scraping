It is Boeing’s largest investment in an unmanned aircraft program outside of the United States. The Loyal Wingman uses artificial intelligence to extend the capabilities of manned and unmanned platforms.
The partnership between the Royal Australian Air Force and Boeing Australia is responsible for developing and testing this aircraft.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the program will boost Australia in three areas—Australia’s defence industry, global export potential, and job creation.
Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said that this is a significant milestone for our country, especially for local industries. Writing on Twitter on May 4, she said, “It’s the first time [Australia’s] industry are locally designing, developing and manufacturing an aircraft of this type.”
