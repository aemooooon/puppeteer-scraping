A new report by the the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) highlights that a coming generation of China hypersonic weapons traveling at 3,800 miles an hour would be hard to defend against.
The United States and its NATO allies have complained since 2013 that Russia was violating the INF Treaty. Experts, however, say it was Beijing’s efforts in becoming a leader in developing hypersonic missile technology that motivated Washington to take action to counter the new military threat.
The two major weapons classifications are hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) and hypersonic cruise missiles (HCMs). HGVs are launched by a rocket to high altitudes 25 and 60 miles and then glide to their targets. HCMs are initially powered by high-speed rocket engines to altitudes of between 12 and 19 miles before their own ramjet or supersonic scramjet engine kicks in to achieve supersonic speeds.
The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Air Force, the Navy, and the Army have been are leading research or developing hypersonic weapons for a variety of applications and launch methods. NASA has also conducted work related to hypersonics for vehicles and spacecraft reentry into the atmosphere.
The GAO said that U.S. hypersonic weapons would be able to strike fleeting targets, “such as mobile, high-value military targets and adversary weapons systems.” Using advance “agile targeting,” U.S. warfighters’ ability to maneuver hypersonic weapons in mid-flight will make it extremely difficult for targeted adversaries to counter attacks.
One of the biggest challenge for weapons traveling at hypersonic speed is developing advanced exterior materials that can protect internal guidance electronics from temperatures that exceed 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit during acceleration and flight, the report said.
