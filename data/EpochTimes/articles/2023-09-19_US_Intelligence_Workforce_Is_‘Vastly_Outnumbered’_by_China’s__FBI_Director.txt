The United States is facing a spy threat from communist China that is greater in scope than the Soviets during the Cold War, according to FBI Director Christopher Wray.
“The fact is that compared to the P.R.C., we’re vastly outnumbered on the ground, but it’s on us to defend the American people here at home,” Mr. Wray said, referring to China’s official name, the People’s Republica of China. “I view this as the challenge of our generation.”
“They’re going after everything,” Mr. Wray said. “What makes the P.R.C. intelligence apparatus so pernicious is the way it uses every means at its disposal against us all at once, blending cyber, human intelligence, corporate transactions and investments to achieve its strategic goals.”
“I’ve been very vocal since early in my tenure that there is no country—underline no country—that represents a broader, more severe counterintelligence threat to the United States than the People’s Republic of China,” Mr. Wray said.
“And limiting or hobbling or losing our access to 702 would, in my view, be a form of unilateral disarmament in the face of the Chinese Communist Party.”
FISA Section 702 allows for intelligence gathering on foreign agents operating outside the United States. It is scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2023, and must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.
The Chinese regime is trying to steal U.S. innovation in artificial intelligence, Mr. Wray warned, explaining that the United States leads the world in artificial intelligence (AI) development and about 18 of the 20 most successful AI companies in the world are American.
“Needless to say, that puts a gigantic bullseye on them from the Chinese government,” he added.
“While the United States has important advantages, China may be able to quickly take the lead in government and military adoption of AI capabilities. This is an outcome that the United States should seek to prevent,” Mr. Allen stated.
