Money, including how we use and borrow it, has changed dramatically in just the past decade. Traditional payment methods are now peer-to-peer, contactless, and mobile versus cash, check, or plastic. We have primarily the internet and technology to thank for the new ways we conduct transactions. Now, imagine the future of money in real estate in the next decade.
For example, online brokerages Redfin, Opendoor, and Purplebricks are offering a hybrid real estate transaction model that allows homeowners and homebuyers to become more involved while retaining the expertise of a real estate agent. One of the prime money trends illustrated here is the migration to a digital transaction process. Some online real estate transaction companies, including Beycome, even forgo the traditional commission fees, offering more money for the seller, and fewer upfront costs for the buyer.
The future promises even more opportunity for customers to gain control of real estate transactions; for escrow periods to shorten, and for transaction costs to decline. These changes could also open the door to real estate matching services, similar to online dating models. This would use specific metrics and factors to help buyers locate the ideal properties, and to help sellers offload their properties at a faster rate.
