The number of teenagers using Facebook has drastically plummeted by nearly 40 percent, according to new data from the Pew Research Center.
Meanwhile, the share of teenagers using Tik Tok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has surged according to the survey, with 67 percent of those ages 13 to 17 saying they use the platform.
U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that American users’ data on TikTok may be used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), particularly in light of national security laws in the country that compel local companies to cooperate with Chinese intelligence agencies when requested to do so. Officials say this could pose national security risks.
TikTok has repeatedly denied such allegations.
The Chinese-owned platform’s usage is followed by Instagram (62 percent) and Snapchat (59 percent), the use of which has grown since 2014.
YouTube tops the social media platform used by teens, according to the survey, with 95 percent saying they use it in 2022.
The survey from Pew Research Center was conducted from April 14 to May 4, 2022.
Two of the platforms that were previously tracked by the center, Vine and Google+, no longer exist.
“Despite Facebook losing its dominance in the social media world with this new cohort of teens, higher shares of those living in lower- and middle-income households gravitate toward Facebook than their peers who live in more affluent households,” the research also noted.
