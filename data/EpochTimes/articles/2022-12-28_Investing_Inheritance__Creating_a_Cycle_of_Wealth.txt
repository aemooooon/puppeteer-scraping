Securing your financial security is a colossal task. People are prioritizing the safety of their funds as inflation rises and federal interest rates seem to fluctuate daily. It’s a to-do that doesn’t only affect yourself—it also influences future generations. Creating a cycle of wealth that seeps into your whole family can start—or continue—with your financial choices.
Many influences affect the ability to create and nourish generational wealth. The breadth and variety of assets depend on individual circumstances, such as previous inheritances, investment savvy, and geographic or racial privilege. Not everyone may have the resources to invest confidently, so beginning your wealth journey may have to wait.
However, forging generational wealth is possible if it is within your means. It could or could not amount to millions, relying on a recipe of luck, good decisions, and adherence to advice.
To avoid one mishap jeopardizing everything, ensure resources are spread wide but not thin. Research index funds or renovate your forever home. These projects have vastly different perspectives, yet both add to generational wealth.
Depending on the age and circumstance of the beneficiaries, having a legal entity preside over the funds may be wise for a time. Regardless of your chosen method, no time you invest in financial investments matters if there isn’t a written plan—with witnesses—for where it will go.
