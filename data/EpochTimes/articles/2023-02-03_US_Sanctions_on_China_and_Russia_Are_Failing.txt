Sanctions against China and Russia are leaking across a broad swath of goods to the point of ineffectuality, according to new reporting this week.
Despite targeted sanctions on Russian chip imports, they increased between 2021 and 2022 from $1.82 billion to $2.45 billion.
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey also sell chips to Russia. As late as December 2021, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore continued to export drones to Russia, according to data analysis by the Free Russia Foundation. The share of imports from Russia jumped between 2021 and 2022 for China, Turkey, and Italy.
The latter country isn’t the only democracy trading with Russia.
This is partly by design. Most Russian oil is sold below the price cap of $60 per barrel imposed by the West as an alternative to an outright ban. An outright ban, it was feared, would increase energy price inflation.
But the lack of a ban paired with an artificially low price is also expanding Russia’s global market share of energy exports. Russian oil exports increased from about 140 billion barrels in December to almost 160 billion barrels in January.
But the biggest beneficiary of all is Russia. It continues to accrue over $100 billion dollars in oil revenues despite threatening war against NATO and executing war against Ukraine, including its innocent civilians.
Increasing sanctions on Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea—the world’s four most dangerous dictatorships—is probably the right approach. Not to penalize them for their aggression would invite more of the same from not only them, but from other dictators around the world who are watching the response of the United States and our allies for any sign of weakness.
But sanctions must be imposed with clear eyes. Increasing sanctions on the four rogues will drive them closer together and could provoke them further.
In the best-case scenario, it could force some of them away from aggression and toward democratization.
