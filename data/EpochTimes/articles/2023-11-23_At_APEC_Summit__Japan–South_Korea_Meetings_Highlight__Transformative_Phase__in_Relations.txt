At last week’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco, Japan and South Korea’s leaders convened for their seventh meeting this year, underscoring a strengthened partnership. Their discussions focused on enhancing bilateral relations and collaborating in the face of regional and global shifts, with a particular emphasis on developing joint industrial strategies.
Additionally, both leaders attended a seminar on advanced technology at Stanford University, aligning with the United States to foster global technological advancements.
The annual APEC meeting has been taking place since 1993, with the goal of promoting economic growth throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Leaders from 22 countries attended the summit Nov. 16–17.
On Nov. 16, an unexpected twist unfolded for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida while en route to meet South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. A traffic blockade, caused by President Biden’s convoy, brought Mr. Kishida’s journey to a standstill. Despite a prolonged wait, the blockade persisted, prompting Mr. Kishida to take an unconventional approach to ensure timeliness.
As the scheduled time for the bilateral talks neared, Mr. Kishida, keen on punctuality, opted to leave his vehicle and proceed on foot. After coordinating with U.S. officials, Mr. Kishida and his team navigated through the city streets, arriving at Mr. Yoon’s hotel about 20 minutes behind schedule.
Upon his arrival, Mr. Kishida expressed his apologies for the delay, saying, “I apologize for making you wait. I came here on foot.” Mr. Yoon quickly reassured him, indicating the close rapport between the two leaders.
During their discussion, Mr. Yoon highlighted the active engagement and deepening collaboration between their nations, expressing his commitment to further strengthening communication with Mr. Kishida across various sectors.
In his concluding remarks, Mr. Yoon reflected on the year’s diplomatic progress, saying, “I am pleased that I have already held seven summits with you, Prime Minister, this year, solidifying bilateral trust and continuing the very positive trend in South Korea–Japan relations.”
He underscored the significance of this year’s dynamic exchanges, which have bolstered cooperation at various levels. Mr. Yoon highlighted key milestones, including the two country’s security policy agreement, the economic security dialogue that took place earlier in the year, and the recent revival of the deputy ministerial strategic dialogue, expressing optimism for future high-level economic cooperation meetings to ensure sustained communication.
Mr. Kishida echoed these sentiments, noting: “Together with President Yoon, I have been moving forward bilateral cooperation in the fields of politics, security, the economy, and culture,” and added, “I hope to take this step further.”
He further emphasized: “At this historic juncture, our aim is to lead the world towards unity and cooperation, rather than division and conflict. In this endeavor, Japan and South Korea stand as partners.”
Kim Tae-woo, former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification and a professor at Keimyung University, offered a historical perspective to The Epoch Times.
“Korea–Japan relations, once marred by a troubled past, first saw significant improvement during the Kim Dae-jung era. The current era marks a second wave of enhancement, with this year’s seven summits being the most frequent in the history of Korea–Japan leadership dialogues. We are witnessing a transformative phase in relations, arguably the most fruitful period in their bilateral history,” he said.
However, Mr. Kim tempered this optimism with caution, acknowledging potential challenges.
“Despite the shared security concerns regarding North Korea, contentious issues like the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute and historical grievances pose latent risks. These matters are highly volatile and could potentially reset Korea–Japan relations if reignited,” he said, advocating for a gradual, stage-by-stage approach to resolving these issues over time.
Condoleezza Rice, the Tad and Dianne Taube director of the Hoover Institution, moderated the discussion at Stanford, which centered around innovation and the future of science and technology.
During the seminar, Mr. Kishida urged Japan and South Korea to collaboratively establish supply chains for decarbonization fuels, focusing on hydrogen and ammonia, which do not emit carbon dioxide when burned. He highlighted their potential application across various sectors, including electricity and transportation, in both nations.
Mr. Kishida underscored the interconnected nature of security and technology, stating, “No country can protect itself alone.” He stressed the synergy of Japanese component and material technology, South Korean large-scale production capability, and American prowess in artificial intelligence and chip technology as being fundamental to innovation.
The Japanese prime minister expressed hope that a technological collaboration would exemplify the evolving dynamics of Japan–Korea relations and called the seminar a stepping stone for Japan, the United States, and South Korea to collectively “enrich the lives of mankind.”
Mr. Yoon added his perspective, emphasizing the shared ideals and values of South Korea, the United States, and Japan. He proposed initiating joint projects in cutting-edge technology, showcasing a united approach to technological advancement and its benefits to humanity.
This collaborative effort at the tech research hub was a strategic move to implement the joint statement from the August trilateral summit at Camp David. The statement, crafted in response to economic pressure from the Chinese Communist Party, called for robust cooperation in economic security and technology among the three nations.
In addition to the Stanford seminar, Mr. Kishida and Mr. Yoon met with representatives from Japanese and South Korean startups, further emphasizing their commitment to technological and economic collaboration.
