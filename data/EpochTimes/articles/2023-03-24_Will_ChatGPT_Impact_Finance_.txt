Artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t new, but it is evolving. The latest ChatGPT, or Chat-generated pre-trained transformer, is the newest AI to hit the headlines. Its developers claim it has numerous applications in everyday life.
ChatGPT’s data sources are textbooks, various articles, and websites. It uses these sources to model its language when responding to human interaction.
Most robo-advisors use modern portfolio theory to build passive, indexed portfolios for their users. And once the portfolios are built, the robo-advisor continually monitors them. They ensure that optimal asset class weighings are maintained.
So, if you want to ask it how you should diversify your portfolio, you’re going to receive a generic answer that probably doesn’t pertain to you. Instead, you must give a scenario of who you are and what you want to achieve. Or, if you follow an investment style, ask ChatGPT to create a portfolio that mimics the style of Ken Griffin or Warren Buffet’s Berkshire.
ChatGPT can take the question you ask and come up with a plan. But that’s only half the story. It can’t ask probing questions about your finances. It doesn’t dig deep. A human will follow up with questions and help guide you to the answers needed. Because ChatGPT can’t go in-depth, it cannot help you set realistic goals.
If you’re using ChatGPT, it’s important to ask the right questions. Remember, it can’t follow up like a financial advisor can, so your answer won’t be in-depth.
