TikTok issued a statement on Jan. 27 that “given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India.”
The magazine cited insider sources at ByteDance who said the staff in India will be reduced to “skeletal staff in select departments such as legal, administrative, human resource, accounts etc, to facilitate the settlements and engagement with the government,” according to Business Today’s Jan. 28 report.
India was once TikTok’s largest market, with more than 200 million users in the country.
The Indian government said in a press release that those applications were engaging in activities “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”
The Indian government allowed the Chinese app developers to explain their standpoints in terms of privacy and security requirements and to answer a series of questions.
However, Indian authorities were not satisfied with their responses.
On Jan. 25, India’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology issued a new notice to permanently ban 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok and messaging app WeChat, according to Indian media reports.
On Jan. 28, the Chinese regime’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng criticized the Indian government for enacting the permanent ban, urging New Delhi to help “bring the bilateral economic ties back to normal.”
