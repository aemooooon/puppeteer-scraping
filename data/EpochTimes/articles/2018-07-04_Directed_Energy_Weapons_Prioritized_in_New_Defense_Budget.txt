Directed-energy weapons (DEW) are being prioritized in the new defense budget, which could promote further development of sonic and electromagnetic weapons.
It specifically mentions tests at the High Energy Laser System Test Facility of the Army Test and Evaluation Command.
The weapons systems are still relatively mysterious, yet have made headlines recently due to suspected sonic attacks used against U.S. diplomats in China and Cuba.
“As late as the early 1990s, information concerning non-lethal weapons (NLW) and their human bio-effects—at least the advanced DEW forms of them—was discussed primarily within the classified world,” he said.
“As an example, high-powered microwaves (HPM) targeted at humans can raise their brain temperatures, resulting in seizures and damage, while infrasound can create vibrations in the human body, causing disorientation and incapacitation, or potentially even causing organ failure.”
Another section of the defense budget establishes authority for a Joint Directed Energy Transition Office to conduct research on high-powered microwave capabilities.
And another section lists “directed energy” as the top priority of four categories for research and engineering. The other three categories are hypersonics, artificial intelligence, and future space satellite architectures.
