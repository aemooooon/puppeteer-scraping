FTC Bureau of Competition Director Holly Vedova said the proposed vertical deal could offer the influential chipmaker control over the computing technology and designs relied on by the rivals for innovative next-generation technologies, including those used to run data centers and driver-assistance systems in cars.

He keeps a Buy rating on Nvidia shares with a $350 price target (8.9 percent upside).
