Google’s decision to cut ties with Pentagon’s artificial intelligence program could put American lives at risk, according to a former top U.S. defense official, who pointed out that the tech giant is helping U.S. adversaries such as China develop AI technology that could be used against the United States in a conflict.
As a result, Google CEO Sundar Pichai promptly canceled the program and pledged that the company will not use AI to create weapons of war or illegal surveillance, or to cause “overall harm.”
“I fully agree that it might wind up with us taking a shot, but it could easily save lives,” Work said, who started Project Maven during his tenure at the Pentagon.
“I believe the Google employees created an enormous moral hazard for themselves.
“[Project Maven] might save 500 Americans or 500 allies or 500 innocent civilians.”
