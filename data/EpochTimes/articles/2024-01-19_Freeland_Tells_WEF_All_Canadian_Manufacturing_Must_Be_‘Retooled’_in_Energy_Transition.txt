Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told an audience in Davos that “all” of Canada’s manufacturing must be retooled to make way for the energy transition.
“I think that right now we’re living through a moment which is comparable only to the industrial revolution itself, in terms of the energy transition and the way we need to retool all of our manufacturing,” said Ms. Freeland on Jan. 18 while attending the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting that takes place in Davos, Switzerland.
“That is huge,” she added, without expanding further.
Ms. Freeland recounted to the panel an interaction the day prior with an unnamed major business player who warned her about the potential impacts of the economic transition.
“I spoke yesterday to a very significant international business leader who was also a big investor in Canada,” she said, adding that he told her “all the countries in the world need to be very careful that decarbonization does not mean de-industrialization.”
Ms. Freeland said she thought this was an “extremely smart comment.”
Canada is “absolutely determined” that decarbonization will create more jobs, growth, and manufacturing, she added.
“We recognize government needs to play a role to make that happen,” said the minister, noting her government has earmarked around $120 billion for policies pursuing the industrial transformation.
