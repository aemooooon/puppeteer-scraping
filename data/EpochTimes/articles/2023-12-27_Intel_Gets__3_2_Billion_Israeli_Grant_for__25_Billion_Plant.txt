Intel will receive a $3.2 billion grant from the Israeli government in exchange for investing $25 billion in the country for chip development.
With the new investment, Intel intends to upgrade and expand the Kiryat Gat wafer fabrication site, located just 26 miles from the Gaza region. Kiryat Gat, also called Fab 28, manufactures Intel’s 10-nanometer chips.
Intel has not said what technology will be produced at the new plant. Dubbed Fab 38, it is scheduled to start operations in 2028 and run through 2035.
“Such an investment, at a time when Israel is facing a war against absolute evil, a war in which good is obliged to defeat evil … is an expression of confidence in the State of Israel and the Israeli economy.”
“We have over 20,000 souls … between our direct employees and contractors and construction workers. And about 17 percent of them are on reserve duty today. We’ve lost several in the conflict from the family, and some of our members have lost their children, and we still have some hostages,” he said in a Dec. 13 interview with Fox News.
“We’ve supported our teams financially, emotionally … The Israeli people are the most resilient people on earth. They have not missed a single wafer commitment or product commitment despite the conflict. That’s why we believe so deeply in them.”
