Wall Street closed lower, despite a blowout profit report from Nvidia, as bond yields rose ahead of a highly anticipated speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
The S&P 500 fell 1.3 percent Thursday after erasing an earlier gain. The index is still a touch higher for the week. The Dow fell 373 points, and the Nasdaq lost 1.9 percent.
Nvidia ended slightly higher after its profit report topped high expectations and raised hopes that this year’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology isn’t just hype. But the rest of the stock market was weaker as rising Treasury yields cranked up the pressure.
