The process is simple: Once you join a platform, you put up a description of your product or service and the target amount of money (or goal) required to start operations. You can set up rewards for contributors based on how much they contribute.
Once you reach the target in donor contributions, you just need to pay a small percentage of the target amount—instead of paying loan interest—something like 3–5 percent of the collected amount.
The downside is that crowdfunding is not a reliable way to raise revenue. According to reports, just around 20 percent of crowdfunding projects meet with a substantial degree of success. If the target funding is not reached, you will not be qualified for receiving the funds, and donors will be refunded their money.
If they have no minimum revenue qualification to show, the next factor most lenders will ask as criteria to qualify would be some kind of collateral in the form of property or any high-value personal possessions.
In case both the above-mentioned options are not viable for a business owner, there are various online startup business loans that can be considered which provide loans based on different criteria.
An alternative solution, Upstart, utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to assess your professional history, educational background, and location of residence to determine your eligibility for a loan in lieu of a credit history. The application and loan-approval process are relatively quick, and you can have access to your loan within 24 hours, with the loan term spanning from three to five years. The borrower who wants to finance a startup also can choose the monthly repayment date as desired. The portal levies an annual percentage rate that starts from 5.31 percent and can go as high as 35.99 percent. There also is an origination fee that is charged with every loan.
