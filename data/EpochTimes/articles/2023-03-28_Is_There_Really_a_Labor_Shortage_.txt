You’ve probably seen the “help wanted” signs in shops and restaurant windows. Owners and managers complain that they can’t find help. And you know it’s true because it usually takes twice as long to get served as it did before COVID-19.
The pandemic spurred many people to leave the labor force. Older workers moved up plans to retire, and others, who enjoyed enhanced unemployment benefits, were unwilling to take the lower-paying jobs they had previously. Still, some enjoyed working remotely, but when the call came to return to the office, they quit instead.
Workers are quitting and switching to higher-paying jobs. In some instances, they are switching industries. Many cite better pay, benefits, working conditions, and impaired physical and mental health for the switch.
This has put a strain on those good-paying employers.
And with the layoffs from tech firms like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, good-paying jobs are diminishing. These firms saw a boom during the pandemic and, as a result, overhired. With the down economy, the tech firms and others who rely on consumer spending just don’t have the high-paying jobs available.
According to the U.S. Travel Association, two million jobs are available in the U.S. travel industry.
Recruitment intensity tends to be stronger when the labor market is strong and less intense when the labor market is weak. The labor market is currently weak.
Under a labor shortage, you should see wages driven up to attract qualified candidates. But this isn’t the case. In 2023, the emphasis on increasing wages is diminishing.
