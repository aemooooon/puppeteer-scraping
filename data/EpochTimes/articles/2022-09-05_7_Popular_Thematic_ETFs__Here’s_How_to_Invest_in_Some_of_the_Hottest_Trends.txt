Thematic exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, allow you to invest in a number of the hottest trends and industries—from blockchain to cloud computing, and clean energy to cybersecurity. Thematic ETFs are an easy way to play a trend rather than trying to pick a winner, allowing you to ride the wave that’s carrying the whole sector.
Thematic ETFs allow investors who don’t want to do all the analytical work on individual companies to simply buy the industry or trend. So if you see the potential in cloud computing, you can buy the ETF and get a diversified cross-section of the industry at low expense and hassle.
Most ETFs work by replicating a specific weighted index of stocks, and thematic ETFs are often no different. They’ll buy whatever stock is in the index and weight it accordingly in the portfolio. By buying one share of the ETF you’re buying a stake in all the companies in the fund, gaining quick exposure to the theme and a narrow diversification across the companies there.
Thematic ETFs are somewhat more expensive than some of the most popular index ETFs such as those based on the S&P 500. Fees on those popular funds can run less than 0.1 percent per year. In other words, you’ll pay $10 for every $10,000 you have invested in the fund.
While thematic ETF fees may be pricier than these cheap funds, they’re largely in line with the average expense ratio. Typically they’ll charge somewhere between 0.5 and 0.75 percent, meaning you’ll ultimately spend between $50 and $75 each year for every $10,000 invested.
