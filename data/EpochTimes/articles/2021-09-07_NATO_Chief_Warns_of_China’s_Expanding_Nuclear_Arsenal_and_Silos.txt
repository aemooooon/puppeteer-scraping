NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg sounded the alarm over China’s increasing nuclear capabilities on Sept. 6, calling on Beijing to join international efforts to limit nuclear arms.
“China’s nuclear arsenal is rapidly expanding, with more warheads and more sophisticated delivery systems,” he said. “Moreover, China is building a large number of missile silos, which can significantly increase its nuclear capability.
“All of this is happening without any limitation or constraint and with a complete lack of transparency.”
Stoltenberg urged more countries, particularly China, to participate in future talks on limiting nuclear arms.
“As a global power, China has global responsibilities in arms control. And Beijing, too, would benefit from mutual limits on numbers, increased transparency, and more predictability. These are the foundations for international stability,” he said.
Stoltenberg also said that emerging technologies, such as autonomous platforms and artificial intelligence, should also be included in future arms control talks, as they could be weaponized.
“Remaining outside of the pact has allowed China to rapidly expand its missile arsenal as part of a military strategy designed to counter U.S. and allied military power in Asia,” the report reads.
“Despite the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] dramatic build-up of its nuclear arsenal, unfortunately, it continues to resist discussing nuclear risk reduction bilaterally with the United States,” Wood said.
“To date, Beijing has not been willing to engage meaningfully or establish expert discussions similar to those we have with Russia. We sincerely hope that will change.”
