While the threat from Russia has been “particularly obvious,” China will likely be “the single biggest factor” affecting the UK’s technology, the UK’s cybersecurity boss said on Nov. 1.
Cameron said she’s “proud” of the NCSC’s roles in supporting Ukraine’s cyber defence and helping UK organisations fortify their defences.
She also warned that the UK can’t take its eyes off China.
“While the threat from Russia has been particularly obvious over the last year, it’s important not to forget that China’s technical development and evolution—the scale and pace of what they are able to do—is still likely to be the single biggest factor affecting our cybersecurity in the years to come,” Cameron said.
The NCSC is a part of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK’s national security agency.
Regarding state threats, the NCSC annual review named regimes in Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea as presenting “the most acute cyber threat to the UK and its interests.”
The NCSC said UK organisations haven’t been significantly impacted by the cyber front of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but cautioned against complacency as Russia “continues to be a persistent and active threat to the UK and its interests.”
The cybersecurity watchdog also stated that the Chinese regime poses the biggest threat to the UK’s cybersecurity in the coming years.
It stated that China has put “significant resources” into emerging tech research and development, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and semiconductors, in order to achieve “technical supremacy.”
The report also cited FBI Director Christopher Wray as saying that China has “a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined.”
Security Minister Tom Tugendhat announced on Nov. 1 that he’s leading a new task force to “drive forward work to defend the democratic integrity” of the UK.
