A novel blood test designed for speedier diagnosis of a debilitating illness that affects tens of millions of people worldwide shows potential for accurately detecting myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), according to a recent study published in Advanced Science.
The single-cell Raman spectroscopy method successfully determined disease presence and severity in close to 100 study participants with 91 percent accuracy.
Analyses showed that both ME/CFS and MS subjects had notably elevated levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan, related to mood and fatigue, in their PBMCs compared with healthy controls.
According to the National Institutes of Health, up to 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS. One in four people are either bedbound or housebound at some point in the disease. Unfortunately, the prognosis is poor, and most people never regain their whole pre-disease level of functioning. People of all ages, races, and socioeconomic groups can develop ME/CFS, but women are two to four times more likely to be affected than men.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients are often overwhelmed by a tiredness that can’t be remedied no matter how much they sleep. What may seem like simple tasks are exhausting for people with ME/CFS. They can get wiped out by going to the grocery store, showering, or attending a child’s school event.
“Early diagnosis would enable patients to manage their conditions more effectively, potentially leading to new discoveries in disease pathways and treatment development,” the authors wrote.
