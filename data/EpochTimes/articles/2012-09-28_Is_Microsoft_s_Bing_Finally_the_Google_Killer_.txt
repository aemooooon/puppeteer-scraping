   Google’s Worst Enemy - Google  Google business expansions have had as many or more negative effects as profitable ones the last couple of years. The timeline of Larry Page took over the leadership, Google launched Panda, and a paradigm shift away from small publishers and the private web toward major media, some say have shattered SEO and a great many Google relationships. Throw in leaks revealing human filterers taking down site ratings when everyone assumed machines power Google’s anti SPAM unit, and then there are the growing list of competitors to consider - and all those Facebook and Twitter users.     Next, G+ goes live and takes on not only Facebook, but Twitter and anyone in the social sphere. The ITA software acquisition, Zagat, Motorola, rumors of Google Travel, the big picture reveals a company with more competitors and enemies than friends in many ways. Founder Sergey Brin’s “Don’t be evil” echoes idly to an ever diminishing crowd of fans. Microsoft knows the score here, and theKlout announcement proves perfectly what everyone knows is the central issue of business online, user trust.   Mat Honan encapsulates Microsoft’s greatest competitive edge right now, as well as what should be Google’s biggest fear in this article on Gizmodo. The Case Against Google is a story of subversion, trickery, and selling out for monetary gain by the most successful (trusted) company the Internet has yet spawned.

I know the reader is asking; “So, what does Klout mean in all of this?”
