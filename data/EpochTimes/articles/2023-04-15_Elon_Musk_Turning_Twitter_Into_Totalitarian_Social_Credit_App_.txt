Like WeChat in China, Elon Musk seeks to merge Twitter’s social media app, banking, payments, and many more activities into a single source of information—and monitoring.
Twitter, as we know it, anyway, has ceased to exist.

And now we know what it is.
More to the point, do we as individuals have a right to own our lives?
Do we still have the right to privacy in this country?
Does Musk imagine that such an instrument of total control and denial of rights that X could well become would not be used against him at some point?
Does he think that his vast wealth makes him immune from the totalitarian impulses of a one-party deep state?
