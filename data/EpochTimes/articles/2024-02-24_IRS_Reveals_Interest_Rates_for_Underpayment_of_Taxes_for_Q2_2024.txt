The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced what its various interest rates will be for the second quarter of 2024, including the rate applied for underpayment of taxes.
For individual taxpayers, the rate for overpayments and underpayments will be 8 percent per year, compounded daily.
For corporations, the rate for overpayments will be 7 percent, dropping to 5.5 percent for the portion of a corporate overpayment exceeding $10,000.
Large corporate underpayments will carry an interest rate of 10 percent.
In general, the overpayment and underpayment rate for taxpayers other than corporations is the federal short-term rate plus three percentage points.
The rate for large corporate underpayments is the federal short-term rate plus five percentage points.
The tax relief is automatic but applies only to eligible taxpayers who owe less than $100,000 in back taxes. The failure-to-pay penalty will resume on April 1, 2024, for those taxpayers who are eligible for the relief.
Corporate aircraft are often used for both business and personal travel, with personal use of business jets impacting eligibility for certain deductions.
The tax code allows business deductions for the expense of maintaining assets like corporate planes. However, the use of such aircraft for personal travel generally reduces the amount that can be claimed. Also, personal use of a business jet should normally be included in the income of the individual traveling, with implications for the amount of taxes owed.
The IRS said that there hasnâ€™t been enough scrutiny of whether, for tax purposes, the use of jets is being properly allocated between business and personal reasons, and so the agency is ramping up enforcement in this area.
The agency is now putting some of those high-tech enforcement tools to use, and is hiring more examiners, in part to ensure that corporate fliers that do so for personal reasons pay enough tax.
