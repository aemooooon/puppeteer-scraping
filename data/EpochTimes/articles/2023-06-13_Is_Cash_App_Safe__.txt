The bottom line of security with any app depends mostly on the user. If you are alert and knowledgeable of potential scams and how scammers work, it can greatly reduce the likelihood that you will become a victim.
Although Cash App is the most popular app of this type, there are also many others. Some of them would have better levels of protection than others. Remember, though, that hackers and scammers are always at work trying to keep ahead of new security measures. Just because the security is great one day does not mean it will stay that way.
Oftentimes, you may see amazing deals for opportunities to invest. Common sense may tell you that they are too good to be true—and they are. They may offer crypto scams or other investment deals, but they will eventually disappear with your money. The best thing to do is to block users you do not know—before you lose money.
Do not open emails or texts that come from unknown sources. Information coming from Cash App will only have links to their websites: @cash.app, @square.com, or @squareup.com.
When you get a phone call from Cash App Support, they will never ask you for information about your account. It includes your sign-in code, a PIN, or Social Security number. They also will never ask you to make a payment of any kind or buy anything.
