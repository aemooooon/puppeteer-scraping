But when it comes to divining the decisions of an eccentric entrepreneurial genius such as Mr. Musk, one must take care not to miss seeing the batteries for the charging stations.
The two matters at hand in this latest self-engineered controversy of Mr. Musk’s, electric vehicles (EV) and artificial intelligence (AI), are both steeped in ideology. And the PayPal and SpaceX founder has made it clear in recent years what a threat he judges the left-wing fanaticism that has engulfed government and business all over the world to be—enough that he was willing to put $44 billion of his money where his mouth was to purchase the world’s most influential political communications online platform.
“I call them ISIS,” Mr. Musk quipped, asserting that “there’s a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have, you know, strange ideas about what should be done.”
Were it not for Mr. Musk’s acumen, America might not even have a competitive EV car industry worth speaking of as it faces China’s artificially inflated economic threat in the sector. Going forward, as the Biden administration and other fanatics, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, try to make the internal combustion engine illegal within little more than a decade, we should want the likes of Mr. Musk in charge, not the green extremists.
