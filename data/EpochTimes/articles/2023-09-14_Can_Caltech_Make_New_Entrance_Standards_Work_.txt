As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, “At the same time, nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected the applicant’s life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university.” But “universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.”
Basically, the school took the bureaucratic approach and just created more high-salary administrative positions, paid for by the students’ tuition and the taxpayers.
And as I detailed in my article, China and India now are graduating four times the engineering students as America, and Russia twice as many. How are we supposed to compete when our high schools don’t teach STEM courses adequately and universities reduce standards?
Finally, it’s interesting Caltech’s statement said the school “added guidelines regarding the ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) in applications.” Kids these days are using AI for everything. Is it OK to use AI to research, but not to write the application? How will the school make sure the applications are organic?
