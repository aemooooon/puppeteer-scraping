SK Group, the second-largest conglomerate in South Korea, said on July 26 that it would invest an additional $22 billion in semiconductors and other cutting-edge industries in the United States.
The plan was announced after a virtual meeting between SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and U.S. President Joe Biden, who is recovering at the White House from COVID-19.
Biden said the investment is “consequential” to both SK Group and the United States, as it would expand the company’s workforce to 20,000 workers by 2025 while funding a range of U.S. advanced technologies.
SK Group’s investments will include $15 billion in the semiconductor industry through research and development programs, as well as materials and a testing and packaging facility, which will help address supply chain problems, the company said in a statement.
Another $5 billion will go to green energy businesses, including electric vehicle-charging stations, green hydrogen production, battery materials, and recycling.
“In the past, these kinds of technology investments went to China. Today, under my administration, these technology investments are coming to the United States,” Biden said.
