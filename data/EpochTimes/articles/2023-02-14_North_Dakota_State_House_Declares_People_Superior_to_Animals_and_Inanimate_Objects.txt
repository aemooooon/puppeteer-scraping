The North Dakota House of Representatives passed a personhood bill on Feb. 2, declaring humans superior to animals, environmental elements, artificial intelligence, inanimate objects, corporations, and governmental entities.
The rights that come with personhood can be protected in court or government policy.
The Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature promotes a “rights of nature” ideology, which holds that nature should no longer be treated as property under the law and that ecosystems should have rights, according to its website, where it keeps a timeline of “movement milestones.”
An essential step in achieving this is to create a system of jurisprudence that treats nature as a rights-bearing entity and not as property to be exploited at will, the website says.
“The Great Lakes ecosystem, the Great Lakes, and the watersheds that drain into the Great Lakes and their connecting channels, shall possess the unalienable and fundamental rights to exist, persist, flourish, naturally evolve, regenerate and be restored by culpable parties, free from human violations of these rights and unencumbered by legal privileges vested in property, including corporate property,” reads the proposed legislation from New York state Assemblyman Patrick Burke, a Democrat.
The North Dakota bill, which has now moved to the state Senate, affirms that “an individual’s rights are superior and not equal to environmental elements, artificial intelligence, animals, inanimate objects, corporations, or governmental entities” and that “environmental elements, artificial intelligence, animals, inanimate objects, corporations, or governmental entities may not be granted personhood in the state or any right personhood entails.”
