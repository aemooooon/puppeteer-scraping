The United States and China are engaged in a technological arms race. The country with the best artificial intelligence, quantum computing technologies, and cyber weapons will be best positioned to win the wars of tomorrow.
Which begs the question: Who looks likely to win these tech-infused wars?
In other words, the United States is in the lead, but China is catching up. If we look closer, it appears that China has overtaken the United States in many key sectors.
In an effort to combat the threat from the Chinese regime, the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) has prioritized the following five key sectors: artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, biotechnology, semiconductors, and autonomous systems.
In all five sectors, as I demonstrate below, China is already ahead.
Let’s start with AI. As the NCSC researchers noted, China already possesses “the might, talent, and ambition” to win the AI arms race.
The Booz Allen researchers said that by the end of the decade, “Chinese threat groups will likely collect data that enables quantum simulators to discover new economically valuable materials, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.”
“Most of quantum computing’s potential lies more than a decade in the future—but risk management must start now,” the researchers said.
The United States, the CCP’s No. 1 enemy, should take note.
