As the world’s most influential countries unite in a harsh response to the Ukraine invasion, imposing crippling economic sanctions on Russia, the United States is attempting to break up the Beijing-Moscow axis, with possible sanctions on Chinese companies that continue to support Russia.
The United States has responded to the growing threat from communist China by establishing a China Mission Center and by enlisting allies to contain the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
The threat of the old USSR gave rise to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Today, NATO’s mandate has expanded to cover China. Other U.S.-led alliances focused on containing China include the Five Eyes, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad), and AUKUS.
In the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, it appeared that the CCP would support Russia and that economic sanctions against Russia would drive Moscow deeper into Beijing’s orbit. Now, however, the CCP seems to be backpedaling a bit, but remains to be seen how far it would go.
