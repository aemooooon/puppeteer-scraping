The 3 billion-user milestone is seen as an achievement for the company’s social media platform and former corporate namesake.
Facebook user growth has generally remained stagnant over the past few years, as its monthly user base grew by 3 percent in the quarter from the same period last year.
That comes after Facebook reported its first quarterly decline in its history of daily active users in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Meta had a successful second quarter, with 11 percent growth in revenue worth $32 billion, most of it from advertising, and a 16 percent improvement in net income, with $7.8 billion in earnings.
“I think we have the most exciting roadmap ahead that I’ve seen in a while,” Mr. Zuckerberg said, after the last few earnings calls saw a disappointing decline in revenue.
Reels reportedly get 200 billion plays per day across Meta’s series of apps, according to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Mr. Zuckerberg also touted Threads, which is tied in with Instagram, claiming that the new app doing quite well.
Threads hit 100 million users in the first five days, but regular use has since dropped off after the initial rush.
A report last week by analytics firm Similarweb indicated Threads usage had already dropped by half from its initial surge and that daily active users had dropped from 49 million to 23.6 million within a week.
“I’m very optimistic about how the Threads community is coming together,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads.
Not every user was expected to become dedicated Threads fans, said Mr. Zuckerberg, but he claimed that “tens of millions of people come back daily,” in a post. “That’s way ahead of what we expected,” he explained.
Mr. Zuckerberg expects spending on the Metaverse to accelerate, as the company remains dedicated to the VR project, which lost more than $13 billion last year.
Meta CFO Susan Li said that the company expected that the losses facing Reality Labs would “increase meaningfully” this year to get the Metaverse fully operational.
“We remain fully committed to the metaverse vision,” said  Mr. Zuckerberg during the earnings call, who downplayed the significance of the losses.
When investors  asked about the Metaverse expenditures, he pointed to the upcoming Quest 3 virtual reality headset for the system, which is planned to be released in time for Meta’s Connect event in September.
Mr. Zuckerberg called 2023 Meta’s “year of efficiency” in an attempt to streamline the company’s management structure and cut staff.
