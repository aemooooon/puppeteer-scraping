The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is now using purported military drills in the South China Sea to cover up its search for the wreckage for a Chinese military plane that crashed in early March, Taiwan’s intelligence agency said on March 10.
The CCP hasn’t acknowledged the crash. Taiwan-based media outlets have correlated the days surrounding the crash with a sudden drop in Y-8 incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone.
The NSB issued a report to parliament, stating that the drills were serving as a cover for CCP efforts to find and recover the aircraft, and Vietnam’s foreign ministry has filed a complaint with China about the drills.
The report also speculated that the drills would be used to “test the limits of the U.S. and other South China Sea claimants.”
Chen told the island’s parliament that he couldn’t provide further details of the incident, given that the case involved sensitive intelligence.
