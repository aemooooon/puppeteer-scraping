The recent security breach of 23andMe has prompted conservative groups to call for an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to break ties between the U.S. government and China-linked biotech firms.
The 23andMe hack saw the theft of the data of 6.9 million people. Specifically targeted were Chinese Americans and Jews. There’s no specific indication that the Chinese regime carried out the breach, although it’s suspicious that the stolen data specifically targeted Chinese Americans.
Additionally, under China’s National Intelligence Law, private companies are required to share technology and information with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and intelligence services. Beijing prioritizes technologies that are critical to achieving its economic and military policy objectives. These include biotechnology, which can be obtained through tools such as espionage or theft, as well as science and technology investments in the United States, academic and research partnerships, and joint ventures. Consequently, the American private sector is a common target for the CCP’s nefarious activities.
Some in the United States argue that China’s main interest in obtaining these genetic data is to gain an economic advantage by being the first to market new medicines in the future. They also point out that there’s no evidence that China has used any of these genetic data for military purposes or to launch attacks on the United States and other countries. Still, the possibility is certainly there. China amasses conventional and nuclear weapons to use against the United States. Why would the regime shy away from using gene-based weapons?
“Compared with traditional biological weapons and chemical weapons, genetic weapons are more concealable, deceptive, easy to spread and harmful in the long term, and are difficult to prevent, difficult to isolate and low-cost. Once used in war, the consequences will be devastating.”
