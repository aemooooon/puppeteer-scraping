The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, to construct their generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, the defendants copied “millions of The Times’s copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations, opinion pieces, reviews, how-to guides, and more.”
“While Defendants engaged in wide-scale copying from many sources, they gave Times content particular emphasis when building their LLMs—revealing a preference that recognizes the value of those works,” the lawsuit states. “Through Microsoft’s Bing Chat (recently rebranded as “Copilot”) and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products without permission or payment.”
The lawsuit states that the defendant’s illegal use of NY Times’ content puts its work as a reliable, independent news source at risk while violating U.S. copyright law, which the defendants “refused to recognize.”
“The Constitution and the Copyright Act recognize the critical importance of giving creators exclusive rights over their works,” the lawsuit states. “Since our nation’s founding, strong copyright protection has empowered those who gather and report news to secure the fruits of their labor and investment. Copyright law protects The Times’s expressive, original journalism, including, but not limited to, its millions of articles that have registered copyrights.”
According to the lawsuit, there are numerous examples of how the AI programs copy NY Times content verbatim, in addition to attributing incorrect information to the media source.
“Using the valuable intellectual property of others in these ways without paying for it has been extremely lucrative for Defendants,” the lawsuit states. “Microsoft’s deployment of Times-trained LLMs throughout its product line helped boost its market capitalization by a trillion dollars in the past year alone.”
OpenAI’s value has grown to $90 billion since the release of its ChatGPT, according to the lawsuit.
“Defendants’ GenAI business interests are deeply intertwined, with Microsoft recently highlighting that its use of OpenAI’s ‘best-in-class frontier models’ has generated customers—including ‘leading AI startups’—for Microsoft’s Azure AI product,” the lawsuit states.
“For months, The Times has attempted to reach a negotiated agreement with Defendants, in accordance with its history of working productively with large technology platforms to permit the use of its content in new digital products (including the news products developed by Google, Meta, and Apple),” the lawsuit states.
The negotiations were being carried out to guarantee that The NY Times was able to maintain control over its intellectual property rights while assisting in the development of artificial intelligence in “a responsible way,” the lawsuit states.
Artificial intelligence programs have become a threat to journalism, the lawsuit says.
“If The Times and its peers cannot control the use of their content, their ability to monetize that content will be harmed,” the lawsuit states.“With less revenue, news organizations will have fewer journalists able to dedicate time and resources to important, in-depth stories, which creates a risk that those stories will go untold. Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”
This was followed by an end to a former commitment to keeping its research and development open to the public, the lawsuit states.
OpenAI defended the secrecy as a means to protect its designs from other companies; however, the lawsuit argues that this secrecy is instead to hide the content OpenAI is copying.
After its release in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT “became a household name,” the lawsuit states, garnering 100 million users within three months and generating $80 million a month for the company.
The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft has been “intensely involved” in developing and commercializing OpenAI’s programs.
“Microsoft is the sole cloud computing provider for OpenAI,” the lawsuit states. “Microsoft and OpenAI collaborated to design the supercomputing systems powered by Microsoft’s cloud computer platform Azure, which were used to train all OpenAI’s GPT models after GPT-1.”
The lawsuit alleged that both Microsoft and OpenAI “acted jointly” in copying massive amounts of The NY Times’ content to train the AI programs so that they could imitate the media outlet’s writing.
“The Times invests enormous resources in creating its content to inform its readers, who in turn purchase subscriptions or engage with The Times’s websites and mobile applications in other ways that generate revenue,” the lawsuit states. “Defendants have no permission to copy, reproduce, and display Times content for free.”
The cases will have “far-reaching consequences,” the firm said, about how AI will be used in the future.
