If you happen to be a businessperson, and you happen to be an American citizen, and you find yourself close to investing in China, you might want to think again.
Asked if he has ever invested in the communist nation, Gundlach responded, “never.” Why? He doesn’t “trust the data,” nor does he “trust the relationship between the United States and China anymore.” And for good reason. Relations between Washington and Beijing are at an all-time low. Gundlach believes that “investments in China could be confiscated.”
Wise words.
Moreover, Musk’s willingness to embrace the CCP also exposes a painfully obvious contradiction: as companies like Tesla and Nike (another American juggernaut that seems oblivious to the immorality of the CCP) continue to speak out against perceived abuses at home, they continue to invest more money in China, a country with arguably the worst human rights record on the planet.
Which brings us back to Gundlach’s warnings. Sadly, similar warnings have been issued for years. In the United States, very few people in positions of genuine power appear to have heeded them.
