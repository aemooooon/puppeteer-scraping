McGill University professor Benjamin Fung said he “welcomes” the decision by Canada’s immigration office to raise the bar for visa applications, noting that professors rely on immigration officers to vet the potential security of foreign students.
In an interview with NTD, a sister outlet of The Epoch Times, Mr. Fung applauded the court decision, stating, “As a professor, we can only evaluate the academic standards—whether [a student] has a good GPA [Grade Point Average] or a good research background. But we don’t have the authority, we don’t have the capability to evaluate the risk. We rely on the immigration officer to do the task.”
The visa officer also cited open-source information reporting on China’s reliance on science and technology students as “non-traditional collectors” of information to advance the regime’s military and other interests, according to the court decision.
“I think Canada is following that trend, even though we may not have an explicit policy for doing this yet,” Mr. Fung said. “But I think this is on the right path that we should consider defining or clearly defining some sensitive areas.”
