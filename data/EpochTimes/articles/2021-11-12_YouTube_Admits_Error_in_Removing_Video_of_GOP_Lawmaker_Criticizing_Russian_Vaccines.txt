YouTube confirmed it acted incorrectly when it removed a video of a speech by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) when he disparaged Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine rollout.
YouTube did not elaborate on why the video of Issa was removed. The California lawmaker’s speech was given at the EDGE 2021 conference in July.
In Twitter earlier this month, Issa decried YouTube for allegedly censoring his comments at the conference.
“In my now-censored speech, I pointed out that Russia’s vaccine program was inferior to Operation Warp Speed,” said Issa on Twitter, referring to the Trump administration’s program to assist in the development and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.
Issa asserted that Moscow “repeatedly exaggerated their vaccine’s effectiveness every time another country launched a better one. Is any free speech on vaccines allowed?”
“They don’t take down the [The Associated Press], they don’t take down the [New York Times], but they will take down Darrell Issa for a completely benign statement that our product was better,” he added to Fox News.
Referring to his speech, Issa alleged that YouTube is “sort of calling me a vaccine-denier when I’m talking about our product being better than a product from a country that didn’t have third-party review is a pretty amazing level of scrutiny.”
“I think it shows just how much they’re making decisions based on who says something, not what they say,” he argued, according to Fox.
