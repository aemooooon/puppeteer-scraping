In his first overseas trip since taking office, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has visited his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese in Sydney.
Mr. Luxon said that in a “more challenging and complex world” the relationship in Australia, being New Zealand’s close ally, was “very foundational.”
In turn, the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was “absolutely delighted” to host Mr. Luxon.
“Australia and New Zealand, of course, share history, geography, values and a common strategic outlook, and our relationship has never been more important,” Mr. Albanese said.
When Mr. Luxon was CEO of Air New Zealand and Mr. Albanese was Transport Minister, the pair had formed a friendship based on being “aviation nerds,” he added.
Mr. Luxon mentioned his interest in talking further about security in the region and the two countries’ economic agendas.
The Australian and New Zealand ministers of foreign affairs and defence will hold their first joint meeting in the new year “as quickly as possible” after Christmas, Mr. Luxon announced, to ensure their plans and responses are “aligned and coordinated.”
He also committed New Zealand to doing its share in security and defence in its alliance with Australia, and announced it will also explore joining Pillar 2 (the non-nuclear section) of the AUKUS security pact.
He said the agreement was important in ensuring security in the region while a “number of countries were increasing military capabilities.” He did not specifically name China.
