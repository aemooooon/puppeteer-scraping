Near the end of 2022, a computer system called ChatGPT was released. It is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that allows anyone to ask questions. It responds using text similar to what a human would write. It is the first of its kind offered to the public, with other models released from other companies since.
A problem noticed right away was that ChatGPT did not show why one course of action may be better than another. Also, it did not provide specific examples or show what to do in unique circumstances.
As an example, when asked to provide the best investments that offer interest rates better than inflation, it provided many ways to earn interest, but did not say which ones might be best at a particular age. Of course, it could be because the question did not ask to show that information.
Being based on computer programming, ChatGPT is currently limited, and will always be limited, by one major factor: It can only provide answers based on the information provided. It searches the internet for answers, but if it does not have enough information about what you are looking for, it could give you a misleading answer. It is unable to know your financial situation, what you want to do or do not want to do, etc.—unless you put in those details.
Some people who are in good health may need to plan to live to 100, but others who may have had cancer more than once should probably plan on living fewer years—possibly to 75 or 80. Being healthy may mean you can wait until 70 before taking Social Security, but someone with poor health may need to take it much earlier to help meet rising healthcare costs.
Even though artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing, it is still too soon to be able to rely on financial advice given by ChatGPT or other AI bots. Interestingly, the answers it gave even advised consulting with a professional financial adviser, and it denied having enough information to provide the best advice you could get. An estate planner will look at your entire financial situation, find out where you want to go, and advise you about the best way to get there—as well as helping you to avoid problems. They will also help bring up questions you (or ChatGPT, either) may have never thought of.
