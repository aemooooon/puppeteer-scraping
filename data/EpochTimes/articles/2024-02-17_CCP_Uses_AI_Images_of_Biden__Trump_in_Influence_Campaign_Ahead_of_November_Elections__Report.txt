A Chinese Communist Party (CCP) operation nicknamed “Spamouflage” is using artificial intelligence (AI) and social media to sow discontent and amplify division in the United States ahead of November’s presidential election, according to a report.
“The bulk of the content appears aimed at creating a sense of dismay over the state of America without any clear partisan bent,” the report says. “It focuses on issues like urban decay, the fentanyl crisis, dirty drinking water, police brutality, gun violence and crumbling infrastructure.”
Spamouflage created artificially generated images to drive these narratives, some of which were also edited with traditional photo-editing tools like Photoshop. The report includes many screenshots of these images from X, formerly Twitter.
Another narrative related to the election focused on portraying President Biden in a negative light, the report says. Meanwhile, narratives relating to President Trump had been “somewhat ambiguous.”
“It is unclear whether this reflects a strategic goal of CCP-aligned networks or is simply because Biden is the current President,” the report says.
The report said Spamouflage’s efforts had limited success in generating engagement.
Citing the DOJ’s indictment, the report suggests that the 40 officers appeared “extremely likely” to be involved in Spamouflage’s influence campaign.
