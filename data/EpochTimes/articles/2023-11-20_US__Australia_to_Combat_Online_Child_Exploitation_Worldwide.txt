Canberra and Washington have taken another joint step forward to combat online child sexual exploitation.
Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas have convened the inaugural meeting of a joint council on tackling the issue.
“The United States and Australia are steadfast in combatting all forms of child exploitation and abuse.”
Mr. Dreyfus said they have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable group of the society.
“Online child sexual exploitation and abuse has a devastating impact on victims and survivors,” he said on Nov. 19. “The Albanese Government is committed to preventing and responding to child sexual abuse that occurs online or in any other setting, and supporting all victims and survivors.”
“Every child and young person has the right to be safe from child sexual abuse wherever they are, and it is our collective responsibility to protect them.”
Mr. Mayorkas said the crime was tragically on the rise around the globe, and there is “no greater law enforcement imperative.”
“We must also hold the perpetrators accountable,” he said. “These online crimes know no geographic boundaries, and the perpetrators are exploiting technological advances to manipulate images and make it more difficult for law enforcement to detect real versus fake images and identify and save true victims.”
“All of this makes it imperative that we take a whole-of-government approach to tackling this scourge, and to work with our allies across the globe.”
Mr. Mayorkas added that one of its great partners to achieve this is the Australian government, which has “prioritised identifying and saving victims of online child exploitation and abuse and bringing the perpetrators to justice.”
Chaired by Secretary Mayorkas and Mr. Dreyfus, the new Joint Council first met on Nov. 16.
