Why is India’s Ministry of Home Affairs looking to ban Shein, and why should the U.S. government take note?
It’s simple. This app, just like the other 53 apps, appears to have links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In India, the app has raised national security concerns. In the United States, the app should also raise similar concerns.
Tom Tugendhat, an expert in Chinese espionage, has accused Shein of essentially being an extension of the CCP, engaging in rampant acts of “surveillance capitalism”—a pernicious system centered around the extraction and commodification of personal data.
