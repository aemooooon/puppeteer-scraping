Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) suggested on Sunday that the U.S. government should deny visas to Chinese students who want to earn their science degrees from American colleges and universities.
Cotton added that student visas for Chinese nationals should be limited to those who seeking to study courses in the Humanities.
“If Chinese students want to come here and study Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers, that’s what they need to learn from America,” he said. “They don’t need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.”
As the number of students from China studying in the United States has steadily grown, American colleges and universities have developed a reliance on Chinese student enrollments to balance their budgets, fueled by an increase in international undergraduates who are willing to pay full tuition. However, there are ongoing concerns about certain Chinese students and academics acting as “non-traditional collectors” of information to advance Beijing’s interests at the expense of America.
