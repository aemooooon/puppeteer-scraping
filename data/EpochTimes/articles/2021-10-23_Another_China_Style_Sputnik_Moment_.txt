The recent Chinese tests of suborbital hypersonic glide vehicles is a wake-up call to U.S. defense planners.
The potential use of hypersonic weapons in a conflict complicates the decision-making process associated with missile defense systems. Hypersonic missile speeds range from Mach 5 (about 3,700 mph) to Mach 15 (about 10,500 mph), with the latter referred to as “high-hypersonic.” The speed of these weapons adds a new calculus to the use of long-range missile defense systems, as the reaction times of anti-missile systems are greatly reduced, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tracking (ISR&T) of the launch vehicles and the missiles in flight is a severe challenge. That time-difference calculation further complicates the ISR&T process when a hypersonic glide vehicle is launched from an orbiting vehicle (an operational FOBS), as the payload could be launched from orbit at virtually any target on Earth without warning.
If deployed in large numbers, a first-launch strike could inflict near-instantaneous effects on a large number of primary and secondary targets at the beginning of a conflict—decapitating a country’s leadership, military command, control facilities, and ground-based satellite communications systems.
