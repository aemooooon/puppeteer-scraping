That’s largely because, unlike other nations that may not share American or Western democratic values, morals and goals, these four nations are aggressive and actively engaged in wars of expansion, or leveraging the threat of war to do so.
China and Russia have the most to lose. Beijing is seeing its dreams of economic primacy collapse under U.S. tariffs. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) legitimacy is fading daily in the face of Hong Kong’s refusal to accept communist rule.
And Russia’s hopes of controlling Western Europe through its monopoly on natural gas sales are all but over. A recent deal signed by Israel, Cyprus and Greece will provide more natural gas at less cost to Europe without the risk of being bullied by Moscow.
All four societies are also retrograde and evil, and seek to impose their dystopian visions upon the rest of the world. This new development doesn’t bode well for the United States or the civilized nations. The historical record of powerful fascist nations teaming up against the democracies of the world is not a pleasant one. (See Germany, Japan and Italy, circa 1939.)
