The maker of a popular fertility app has been sued for allegedly sending personal data to Chinese analytics firms without users’ consent.
The three firms—Jiguang, UMSNS, and Umeng—are all Chinese data analytics companies; Umeng is a Beijing-based startup owned by e-commerce giant Alibaba.
“This was being done in secrecy without ... Premom app users’ knowledge and consent,” it further stated.
The suit alleges that Easy Healthcare “deceived” users “because, unknowing to them, it directly worked with these three Chinese entities prior to launching the Premom app.”
“Prior to its launch, [Easy Healthcare] coded into the Premom app software the ability for these Chinese entities to access and take …. users’ personal information and location data,” it added.
The suit asserts that user data shared with the Chinese firms is stored on servers in China.
“Under Chinese law, all of this data is accessible by the People’s Republic of China, and in turn the Communist Party of China,” it said.
Desiree Moore, an attorney at K&L Gates LLP, which is representing Easy Healthcare, said the allegations in the lawsuit are “without merit” and the company is “confident it will prevail.”
She added, “Easy Healthcare is dedicated to the privacy and protection of its users above all.”
While both U.S. companies have remained committed to the September 2020 deal, the partnership hasn’t been formalized.
