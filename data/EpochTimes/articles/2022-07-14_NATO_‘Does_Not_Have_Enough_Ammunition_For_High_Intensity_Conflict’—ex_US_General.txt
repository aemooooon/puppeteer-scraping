A former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe has told a House of Lords committee in London NATO “didn’t have enough ammunition for a high intensity conflict” like the war in Ukraine.
Hodges, speaking by videolink from Washington, said the review had been a “solid effort” but looked a bit like “doing the best you can with the available resources” rather than anything more.
He said: “After watching the last four-plus months of Russia’s continued attack against Ukraine we’ve been reminded about the enormous consumption of ammunition and other logistics in a high-intensity conflict ... the Chinese are watching this, as well as Russia and other potential adversaries.”
Earlier Professor John Louth, director of the defence, industries, and society research programme at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), was asked by Lord Stirrup, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, if NATO’s forces were “agile” enough to cope with the current threats.
Louth said: “The honest answer is nowhere near enough. That is probably due to the speed of technological change we see now.”
He said: “Flexibility is needed to make sure those emerging elements, like AI, artificial intelligence, which is used in the oil and gas industry, but less so in defence, but much more so in the future. AI is going to be right at the heart of our posture.”
