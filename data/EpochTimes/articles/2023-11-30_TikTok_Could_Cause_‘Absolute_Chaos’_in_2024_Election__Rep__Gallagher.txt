Communist China could leverage indirect control over social media company TikTok to sow discord and disinformation during the 2024 presidential election, according to one congressman.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rules China as a single-party state, could use TikTok to spread propaganda throughout the United States and undermine democratic processes, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) said.
“My view is that TikTok has become a key tool in the CCP’s toolbox when it comes to discourse power,” he said during a Nov. 29 press call.
“There’s no question in my mind that the app could be weaponized as a platform for influencing foreign societies.”
“Via ByteDance, which is a CCP-controlled company, the app could be used as a massive, massive disinformation and propaganda tool,” he said.
“Heading into an election, if most people under the age of 30 are getting their news from TikTok, it can create absolute chaos,” Mr. Gallagher said.
“Imagine all the crazy things that could trend on TikTok prior to the election that could just wreak total havoc in our democracy.”
“This is the dominant media platform in America, and they could sort of influence what Americans think is true,” Mr. Gallagher said.
This is because ByteDance is subject to CCP laws that require all data controlled by Chinese companies to be surrendered to the regime upon request. ByteDance also maintains a CCP committee as part of its corporate structure, which is also required by Chinese law.
“[Xi has] clearly articulated that the smokeless battlefield, as he calls it, is the most important in this competition,” Mr. Gallagher said.
To that end, Mr. Gallagher said that Congress was working on a new bipartisan framework to address “cross-border data flows” and limit adversarial nations’ ability to seize and leverage Americans’ data.
“This isn’t just a TikTok issue,” Mr. Gallagher said. “The issue is foreign adversary control of social media and technology companies in America.”
