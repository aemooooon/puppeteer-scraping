The notification to Nvidia was unexpected because the updated export restrictions would have initially taken effect on Nov. 16, a month after the export control measures were officially announced.
Under the latest requirements, Nvidia must immediately stop shipments of A800 and H800 chips to China.
The company did not specify the reason for the accelerated effective date of the new chip export restrictions.
The new measures from the Department of Commerce closed loopholes in export controls released last year, preventing American chipmakers from selling semiconductors to China that circumvent government restrictions. The latest rules also have circumvention prevention measures to stop companies from exploiting loopholes.
In October 2022, the Biden Administration imposed sweeping export controls on chipmaking equipment to China. The measure aims to contain the Chinese Communist Party’s ambition to strengthen its military with cutting-edge technology.
Most of the imports are from Japan and the Netherlands. The two key U.S.-led allies joined U.S. export restrictions on chipmaking tools to curb China’s chip industry.
Chinese major tech firms like Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) rely on equipment from the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan for equipment to upgrade their chip production lines.
