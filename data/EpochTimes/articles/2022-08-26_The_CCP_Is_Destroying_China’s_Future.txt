Social and environmental costs have long taken a back seat to the Chinese leadership’s drive for national economic and technological development. But now the leader of China is seeking a third term. Has he earned it?
China faces a number of deep-seated and widespread environmental and human crises that are rapidly destabilizing the country.
As the absolute authority over every aspect of Chinese life, the Party leadership bears full responsibility for the country’s policy failures, and examples are plentiful.
As the economic picture grows gloomier with continuously bad news, such as the collapse of the real estate sector, so does people’s outlook on the future.
Of course, this has been just a surface-level discussion of the lesser-known costs of the CCP’s ravaging of China and its people. However, it seems difficult to overestimate the societal impacts that are already beginning to emerge.
From a historical perspective, a nation is made up of three basic parts: people, culture, and the land on which they live. Somewhere way down the line is its economic activity. In the drive for global supremacy, the current leadership is systematically destroying all three, resulting in a desperate people, a cynical culture, and lands and waters poisoned and desolate.
