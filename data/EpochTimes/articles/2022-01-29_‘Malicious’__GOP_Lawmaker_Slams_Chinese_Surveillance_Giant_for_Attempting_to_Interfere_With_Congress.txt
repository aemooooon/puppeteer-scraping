U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) has criticized Chinese video surveillance giant Hikvision over “very malicious and malevolent” attempts to interfere with U.S. government protocols and silence dissenting voices.
“It is really just no business of a foreign Chinese-backed company to be interfering and trying to use and exploit our Ethics Committee to try to spy on and try to cause sanctions or even fining or any other penalties, to be weighed in on a U.S. company that is actually exposing them in the media,” Tenney told NTD, The Epoch Times’ sister media outlet, during a Jan. 26 program.
“It was attempted censorship, using our very own government against another [U.S.] company,” Tenney said during the interview.
“This company is very malicious and malevolent. Hikvision is actually a Chinese-backed state-run surveillance company that actually, sadly, is doing the type of surveillance and video surveillance to actually determine ethnicity. And it’s been used against the Chinese Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China to segregate them and to target them.”
Tenney said many companies in the West hope in good faith that China opens up and minimizes human rights violations.
“But the opposite is true,“ she said. ”They’re really naturally and instinctively authoritarians, and they can be cruel and exacting.
“And they’ve used the United States. And some of these, I'll say naive ... U.S. partners, who have allowed this to continue to fester and grow. ... They undermine freedom and they undermine human rights along the way.”
