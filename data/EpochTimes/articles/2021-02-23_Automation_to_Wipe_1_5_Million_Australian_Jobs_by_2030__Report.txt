Analysing 391 occupations, Forrester found that over the next nine years, jobs involving highly structured administrative tasks, such as those in finance and accounting, were most at risk of disappearing. In particular, as automation becomes more advanced and more integrated into the workforce, Forrester estimates Australia could see 1.7 million new jobs by 2030 that have to deal with the integration of AI.
Sam Higgins, principal analyst at Forrester, warned that all leaders in business and policymaking needed to work in collaboration to address the impacts of automation on the labour market.
Higgins said leaders needed to start planning immediately to minimise the amount of future “digital outcasts” in the Australian job market.
In the report, Forrester suggests several key points which will help Australia deal with the transition, including helping workers and students gain a diverse set of skills and knowledge in technological areas with a particular focus on digital and technical skills in the areas of big data, automation, robotics engineering.
