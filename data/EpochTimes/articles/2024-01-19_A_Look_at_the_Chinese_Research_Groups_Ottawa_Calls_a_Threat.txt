Canada unveiled a list of foreign universities and research institutions linked to military, national defence, and state security entities. Predominantly composed of entities based in China, these organizations are identified as presenting the highest risk to Canadian national security.
Revelations of these institutionsâ€™ participation in the scheme were disclosed by the World Organisation to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong (WOIPFG), an investigative body focused on exposing the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China with the aim of restoring justice.
