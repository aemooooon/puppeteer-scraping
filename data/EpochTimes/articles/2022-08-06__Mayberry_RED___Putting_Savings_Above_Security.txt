And it all began in 1946. “How does that coincide with your post-war commie conspiracy, huh?” Ripper asks. “A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That’s the way your hardcore commie works!”
All these years later, it turns out that small town America’s telecom businesses found themselves riddled with a kind of 21st-century high-tech stealthy threat not too far removed from General Ripper’s fluoridated water supply. Andy Griffith’s innocent “Mayberry R.F.D.” has found reds not under the bed but, rather, over their heads, in the cellphone towers.
But even Cisco, which has been doing business in mainland China since 1994, carefully refrained from criticizing Beijing. For instance, it stated a decade ago as it criticized Huawei, “We respect the efforts the Chinese government is making to increase intellectual property protection” and stressed that rather than there being any governmental strategy of economic aggression, “this dispute involved a very simple claim that one company used the other’s trade secrets and copyrighted materials without permission.”
In 2012, a congressional report found that Huawei’s equipment could be used by Beijing to spy on and even disrupt or cripple the United States’ telecommunications infrastructure.
