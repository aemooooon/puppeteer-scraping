Mark Matthews, head of operations for Deutsche’s corporate and investment bank, told the publication that the robot program, named Operations 4.0, is increasing productivity. It has enabled the bank to “redistribute capacity.”
He said that the program has also helped to save “680,000 hours of manual work.” So far, it has “used bots to process 5 million transactions in its corporate bank and perform 3.4 million checks within its investment bank.”
“It [headcount] will continue to go down; there’s no question about that. Our model is to reduce costs and, at the same time, improve our control environment and the client experience,” Matthews said.
The news comes amid a tough year for banks, with the total number of job cuts announced by banks in 2019 growing to nearly 60,000, Bloomberg reported in September.
Speaking at an event hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, Aoun argued that every person needs to “master how to interact with machines” as AI develops.
