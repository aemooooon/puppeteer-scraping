The creators of a conservative chatbot powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT announced that they shut down the chatbot because of pressure from OpenAI to censor the bot’s responses.
The conservative chatbot, named GIPPR in honor of the late President Ronald Reagan, debuted in May and is part of TUSK, a pro-free speech and anti-censorship web browser.
GIPPR is a modified version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and provides users with answers from a conservative perspective.
The creators of GIPPR said they were forced to sever ties with OpenAI, after they were told that their chatbot failed to “conform to their requirements for what can or cannot be said.”
The actions of OpenAI appear to many conservatives as another example of attempted censorship from the left.
TUSK said it is currently exploring how to make GIPPR operational again and urged users to help them to support defending free speech on the internet.
He said he was shocked after he asked the chatbot questions about cultural issues and politics and received left-wing answers in response.
“We believe that Conservatives are subject to oppressive cancel culture that now includes AI and are expected to exist in a society that tells them what to think and how to act by the progressive left,” Bermant announced after releasing GIPPR.
“It’s time for a TRUTHFUL AI chatbot to take the market by storm and remove the barriers the Radical Left and Big Tech have put in place to allow all Conservatives to enjoy the benefits of AI, without fear of being canceled or shamed for your beliefs,” he said.
