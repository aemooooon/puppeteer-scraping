In the early morning of July 1, China’s top artificial intelligence expert, Feng Yanghe, died at the age of 38 in what the Chinese state media reported as a “traffic accident.”
Reports of Mr. Feng’s death were viewed by hundreds of millions of people on Chinese social media, and many questioned the details of the tragic accident. According to the Chinese state media, Mr. Feng was traveling home in a military limousine after attending an important meeting in Beijing, and the vehicle rear-ended a truck, severely injuring the driver and killing Mr. Feng.
Mr. Feng was born in 1985 in China. In 2003, he was admitted to China’s National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), a school under the direct supervision of the CCP’s Central Military Commission. He conducted a joint research program at Harvard University and the University of Iowa in the United States from 2011 to 2013. He returned to China in 2014 to work as a faculty member at NUDT, where he became an associate professor and doctoral supervisor.
Mr. Feng was recognized as a leading figure in the new generation of AI for the national defense strategy of the CCP. He received generous state funding for research and was the project leader of various Chinese military programs.
According to Chinese media, Mr. Feng’s War Skull system could predict U.S. military operations in the Asia-Pacific region and conduct war drills. It had been reported that Mr. Feng played a leading role in simulating realistic war game scenarios for an invasion of Taiwan.
