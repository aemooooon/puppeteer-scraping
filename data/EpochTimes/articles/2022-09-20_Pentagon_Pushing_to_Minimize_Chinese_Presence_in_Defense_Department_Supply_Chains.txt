The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is taking steps to ensure that U.S. defense companies decouple from supply chains involving China as much as possible.
The magnets are used on the plane’s turbomachine pumps, which are manufactured by U.S.-based Honeywell International. Honeywell has reportedly identified an alternate supplier for the materials while the Pentagon is expected to issue a waiver to resume F-35 deliveries for now.
William A. LaPlante, U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, was asked during a Sept. 9 press briefing why Honeywell hadn’t detected the Chinese component for the better part of the past two decades.
“Any company that says they know their supply chain is like a company saying they’ve never been hacked,” LaPlante said. “So it’s an endless battle.”
He suggested that artificial intelligence and open source tools might be used to track raw materials across supply chain networks in real time.
Analytics company Govini recently issued a report looking at the number of U.S. defense components manufactured in China.
The share of Chinese suppliers in critical industries grew from 6 percent to 9 percent during this period. The prevalence of Chinese companies in the Pentagon’s supplier base will make it difficult to identify all instances where these firms are a single-source supplier of key materials or technology, according to the report.
