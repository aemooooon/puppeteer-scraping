WASHINGTON—U.S. policymakers have difficult decisions to make with the awareness that the Chinese Communist Party’s long-term efforts to become a dominant global power have put at risk the national security and economic interests of the United States, its allies, and its partners, according to a new report to Congress by the top congressional commission on U.S.–China affairs.
Michael Wessel, who has been a USCC commissioner since the agency was created in October 2000, said the 2018 report is “evolutionary.”
“Many of the concerns that we have raised continue to evolve,” he said. “We now see that the public policy system is caught up in part to the assessments we’ve been making for a number of years.
“This year is really about doubling down in terms of the assessment and looking at other tools that can be used to address the challenges we face.”
In the introduction to the report, its authors state: “For several decades, U.S. policy toward China was rooted in hopes that economic, diplomatic, and security engagement would lay the foundation for a more open, liberal, and responsible China. Those hopes have, so far, proven futile.
“Many of those who supported China’s accession to the World Trade Organization believed economic growth would raise the quality of life for the Chinese people, but hoped it would also deepen reform and perhaps eventually spark political liberalization. The opposite has happened.
“The CCP has used economic growth—coupled more recently with its anti-corruption campaign—to strengthen its own grasp on authority, advance its state-capitalist model, buttress authoritarian governments abroad, leverage its market against other nations, and fund a massive buildup of Chinese military power to intimidate and silence its neighbors.”
The report says that China’s economic liberalization has stalled, and many reforms have been reversed. It also describes the damage done to U.S. companies and the economy.
“By 2018, leaders of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force have all publicly referred to China’s military as a ‘peer competitor’ in certain scenarios,” the report states.
“In word and deed, the CCP has abandoned any inclination for economic and political liberalization. Rather than promoting fair trade and investment, China engages in predatory economic practices.
“Rather than providing development finance in line with established rules, China provides loans and investment in nontransparent ways on projects that do not always meet global governance standards and pass tests of commercial viability.
“Rather than respecting other countries’ sovereign rights, China is altering the status quo in the Indo-Pacific and has publicly congratulated itself on its militarization of the South China Sea.
“Rather than promoting the free flow of information and human rights at home and abroad, China is doubling down on censorship and technologically enabled repression, including against China’s Uyghur ethnic-minority population.”
The report uses one full chapter to discuss China’s high-tech development in next-generation connectivity, and finds that “the Chinese government seeks to overtake the United States in these industries to gain a higher share of the economic benefits and technological innovation.”
“Chinese firms have already leveraged strong state support to become global leaders in information technology and network equipment manufacturing, and have strengthened their roles in international standards-setting and deployment of 5G, ” it states.
The reports warn of not only the potential loss of economic and market opportunities, but also the security risks the U.S. would suffer if it can’t catch up in those areas.
