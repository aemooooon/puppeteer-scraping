A new year is supposed to bring meaningful change. More often than not, it does.
However, it’s important to note that change isn’t always a good thing, and new developments aren’t always exciting. In fact, sometimes they’re downright terrifying.
Rubio isn’t an alarmist. In many ways, he’s underscoring the threat from Beijing.
As the aforementioned Washington Examiner piece states that the CCP recently unveiled an “action plan for cooperation” with Latin American countries. What does this “action plan” look like? In short, it’s a “comprehensive” initiative designed to control the region and “threaten U.S. interests.”
Conquering Latin America involves conquering roughly 16 percent of the countries on the planet. As I have noted previously, China has already conquered Africa, home to more than 25 percent of the world’s countries.
Since then, this geopolitical community has become a “benchmark for unity in defense of common objectives such as the search for justice, social welfare, and happiness for the Latin American peoples.” CELAC was created in an effort “to offer Latin America a permanent mechanism to avoid the U.S. tutelage and meddling,” we’re told.
Ever since Colombian President Iván Duque visited Beijing in 2019, the writing has been on the wall. Sadly, it appears to be only a matter of time before Colombia joins the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). If it does, it will join a whole host of countries now quite literally indebted to Beijing.
Why would Colombia make a deal with the devil? Why would its leaders enter a Faustian bargain?
The Foreign Policy piece warns that the Colombian government “is becoming more dependent on Chinese financing and contractors as a source of local job creation.”
Sadly, Colombia’s dependence appears to be reflected across Latin America. Desperation makes people do desperate things.
