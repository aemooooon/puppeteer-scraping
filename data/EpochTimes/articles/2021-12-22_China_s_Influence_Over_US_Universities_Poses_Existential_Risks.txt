In other words, China is developing weapons that “will change the character of warfare.” Which begs the question: Why are U.S. universities helping China advance its military might?
Who benefits when U.S. universities partner with CCP-backed enterprises? In one word: China.
As the report noted, the partnerships strengthen “China’s broader military-industrial complex, including its nuclear program, cyberespionage platforms, and other sensitive weapons research.”
This is deeply concerning. The United States, until very recently, was the dominant player in tech and weapons research. However, things have changed, with China now the ascendant force.
China has copied a number of U.S. aircraft, including the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the Northrop Grumman X-47B, according to the USNI piece. These designs were acquired through highly concentrated cyberespionage campaigns.
The aforementioned Foundation for Defense of Democracies report discusses the dangers of Confucius Institutes (CI), and the ways in which they serve as platforms that advance facets of China’s military-civil fusion (MCF).
China’s CI-enabled alliances, according to the report, “include the establishment of academic and research partnerships between top-tier American institutions and Chinese universities supporting Beijing’s military-industrial complex.”
Under the MCF, China is actively targeting key technologies, including the likes of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, and aerospace technology.
