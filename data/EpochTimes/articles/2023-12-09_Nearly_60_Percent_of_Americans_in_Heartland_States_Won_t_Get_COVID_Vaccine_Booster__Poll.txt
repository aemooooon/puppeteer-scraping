Almost 3 in 5 Heartland residents said they would be unlikely to get the new COVID-19 vaccine, with the highest rejection rates coming from Wyoming at 74 percent, followed by Idaho. In the 12 states comprising the Heartland, only 43 percent of respondents planned to get the vaccine.
Polling results indicated that as public trust in the quality of government health care information waned, so too did the vaccine acceptance rate.
For example, about 70 percent of individuals polled in Idaho rated the quality of government health care information as poor or fair, and about 68 percent indicated they would not get the COVID-19 vaccine this year. In Arkansas, the same percentage of individuals rated the quality of health care information as poor or fair, with about 61 percent indicating they would not get the booster.
Kenneth H. Rabin, a CUNY SPH senior scholar, noted that these numbers are particularly alarming.
“These findings should be a wake-up call to health communicators, as we can no longer rely on mandates and must engage people in real conversations to encourage them to vaccinate themselves and their families,” he said in the Emerson College Polling press release.
Public perception of government health information was nearly equally poor in West Virginia (32 percent), Missouri (30 percent), and Michigan (30 percent).
In addition to their disfavorable view of government health information, many residents polled within the Heartland states believed their health care was worse than in other states. Thirty-eight percent of respondents in West Virginia said their health care is worse than in other states, followed by residents in Wyoming (36 percent), Montana (28 percent), Kentucky (27 percent), and Arkansas (25 percent).
However, residents in Midwestern states have a more positive perception of the health care in their region than those in the rest of the country.
