The tech company’s plan to harvest and harness online public data is raising new privacy concerns.
Google’s previous user policy stated that publicly available information would only be scraped to help train its “language models” for Google Translate.
Nonetheless, the amendments to Google’s previously stated user policy show that it is investing heavily in its AI program and that skimming general search behavior could be a significant factor in its continued development.
The California-based tech company has also announced a new AI-based search system, known as the Search Generative Experience (SGE), as part of its new lineup of AI products.
Twitter also began requiring an account to view tweets, then quietly removed the requirement earlier this week.
