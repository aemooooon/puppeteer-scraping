Rules need to be tightened so ministers and civil servants can’t “go off and help China” after leaving their government jobs, a former diplomat said in light of David Cameron’s return to the government as foreign secretary.
Among other political baggages such as the Greensill lobbying scandal and his resignation over the Brexit vote, Lord Cameron’s return has raised eyebrows amid critics of the Chinese regime as he had heralded the so-called golden era of Sino-British relations while in No. 10.
After leaving Downing Street in 2016, he also served as the vice president of $1 billion China–UK investment fund which never took off since the relationship between London and Beijing soured.
While the new foreign secretary declared on Monday that he had given up all other jobs, there are calls for him to disclose all his past business interests since his company, the Office of David Cameron, was converted to an unlimited private company in April 2020, meaning it no longer has to disclose its income.
The new foreign secretary won’t stay in the post for too long “in all likelihood” as a general election is on the horizon, “and therefore, you have to think of what he’s going to do afterwards and if he’s going to go back to the same sort of business as he’s been working on in the last few years,” he told The Epoch Times.
“And in the context of British politics and Chinese interference in British politics, that raises to me the question of the need to strengthen the powers of ACOBA, which is the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments,” he said.
Under ACOBA rules, ministers have to get approval for any jobs they wish to take in the first two years after they leave government.
“The worry is that in the last years of ministers’ work or civil servants’ work, if they’re worried about ... how they’re going to be employed afterwards, will they please potential employers, whether it’s China, a company, a defence manufacturer, or whatever it is, will that influence the way they make decisions and statements while they’re still in office?” he said.
“If [Prime Minister] Rishi Sunak and he [Lord Cameron] are to convince us that the moment he stops work, he’s not going to go off and help China in the ways that he’s helped recently in the last few years, than they need to show that by strengthening the rules of ACOBA, which would then apply to David Cameron and others when they leave.
“And this needs doing anyway because of China’s interference in our country,” he said.
Mr. Parton also said he agrees with calls for the foreign secretary to disclose his past financial interests because it’s “the best thing” for him to do “if he wishes to engender more trust and prevent attacks on himself by others.”
Upon re-joining the Cabinet on Monday, the foreign secretary said, “Today I resign from all of those things, from all of the businesses I have been helping. The other things I’ve been doing, including being a professor at NYU [New York University], that all stops.”
But Lord Cameron has not disclosed what jobs he had left, raising questions about his financial interests, including any links with China.
On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned when the prime minister will “instruct the foreign secretary to give full public disclosure of his work for Chinese interests.”
Roger Garside, adviser to China Journal of Democracy and author of “China Coup: the Great Leap to Freedom,” said Lord Cameron shouldn’t be brought back to the Cabinet given his record on China.
By creating the so-called golden era, the former prime minister and his chancellor George Osborne “sacrificed Britain’s reputation as a nation that defended the principles of human rights incorporated in the U.N. Charter in order to increase Chinese trade and investment in the UK. This was utterly shameful,” Mr. Garside said in an email to The Epoch Times.
“After being forced to resign as prime minister, Cameron tried to cash in on the favour he believed that he had bought in the eyes of the Chinese communists by working to set up a $1 billion UK-China investment fund aimed at supporting Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative.”
Mr. Garside said Lord Cameron’s record on China “makes him unfit to become a minister of the crown, especially foreign secretary.”
After Lord Cameron appointment, CCP mouthpiece China Daily published an article saying his return “rekindles memory of ‘golden era’ for ties.”
The article said Lord Cameron has “worked on the Belt and Road project and visited China several times” in the past seven years, and expressed hopes that new foreign secretary would lend momentum to “constructive engagement between China and the UK.”
“Under his government, the UK was totally silent on human rights issues in China,” the human rights advocate said.
“And then, of course, after he left office, he, in a private capacity took up a role with the Belt and Road Initiative. So that’s very troubling.”
Mr. Rogers said he’s been concerned for a long time about the government’s “soft pedalling” on China.
While the move is “in a sense ... in keeping with the direction that the U.S. and the Australian administrations have been taking in recent months” and it’s necessary to prevent a war with China over Taiwan, “I am concerned that there’s also a tendency to want to revive the business relationship. And I think we'll just have to watch what David Cameron does and watch it very closely,” he said.
