Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s CEO sent a note to employees Friday announcing the elimination of 12,000 jobs, as a response to economic changes over the past two years.
For the U.S. layoffs, the tech giant will provide a severance package and for overseas employees they will follow local practices.
“As an almost 25-year-old company, we’re bound to go through difficult economic cycles. These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” he wrote.
Echoing Microsoft’s announcement, Pichai talked about the company’s focus on artificial intelligence. This reflects renewed competition between the tech giants sparked by Microsoft’s growing partnership with the San Francisco startup OpenAI.
“We have a substantial opportunity in front of us with AI across our products and are prepared to approach it boldly and responsibly,” he wrote.
The 12,000 jobs amount to 6 percent of Alphabet’s workforce. Pichai became CEO of Alphabet and Google in 2019.
“Ad growth has come off the boil, a sharp contrast from the busy days of the post-pandemic re-opening which saw a surge in consumer spending,” she said. The company faces competitive and regulatory threats as well, she said.
It was unclear if Alphabet would take a one-time financial charge related to the job cuts. Microsoft’s severance packages, lease consolidation, and hardware-lineup changes will cost the company more than $1 billion, it said earlier this week.
