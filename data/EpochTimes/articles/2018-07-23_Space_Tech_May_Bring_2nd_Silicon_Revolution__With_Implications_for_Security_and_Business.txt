We can largely thank the moon race of the 1950s and ‘60s for the technologies at the foundation of modern cell phones, computers, and GPS. With a new space industry on the horizon, and with talks of military operations in space, it’s possible the world could see another technological revolution.
These developments could have broad implications for global security and the global economy. To better understand the situation and how it may develop, I spoke with Robert J. Bunker, adjunct research professor at U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute.
Space is and will be an integral part of future warfare—it is the ultimate physical high ground. Satellites are key for national military ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance], and precision strike [via GPS] capabilities. If—or more likely, when—these ISR and precision capabilities are combined with conventional strike weaponry placed in space, principal warships [aircraft carriers] could be engaged with hypersonic weaponry—“Rods from God”—with minimal engage times. This is just one potential example of space power influencing terrestrial combat.
What Google and other high-tech companies are doing with AI and facial recognition for commercial purposes also has direct military and military-space applications. Thus, at the high-tech end, this is becoming a blur of capabilities.
Also, given what we have seen with China, they have been far more willing to export their weaponized drones internationally to obtain hard cash and to cultivate foreign influence. If the United States does not export some of these space technologies to its close allies in the future, they may begin to increasingly look to China for such sales.
