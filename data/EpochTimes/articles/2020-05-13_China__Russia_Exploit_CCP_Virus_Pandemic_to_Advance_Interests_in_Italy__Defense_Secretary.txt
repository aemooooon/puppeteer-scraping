Defense Secretary Mark Esper told Italian newspaper La Stampa in an interview on May 4 that Russia and China are using humanitarian assistance provided to Italy to advance their own interests.
“I have repeatedly called for Russia and China to be transparent with information during this crisis,” Esper said, adding that he recommended that “their donations to other countries be of quality and come without strings.”
The assistance to Italy, one of the “closest and oldest Allies” of the United States, will not only help Italy to fight the CCP virus outbreak but will also counter the Chinese and Russian disinformation campaigns, and “lessen the risk of re-infection from Europe into the United States,” Trump said.
The humanitarian aid to Italy leverages the current presence of 30,000 U.S. military personnel and their family members in Italy so it will affect neither the readiness nor health of the military force in the United States nor their participation in the domestic response to the CCP outbreak, Trump’s order says.
The delivery of medical supplies from Russia to Italy was accompanied by “over 100 Russian military personnel trained in biological, chemical, and nuclear decontamination,” reported CSIS.
Esper told La Stampa that some actors “may seek to use the pandemic and resulting economic challenges we all face as an opening to invest in critical industries and infrastructure, which in turn may affect long-term security.”
NATO defense ministers agreed during a meeting that “potential adversaries will almost certainly look to exploit this situation to further their own interests and try to sow division in the Alliance and in Europe,” Esper told La Stampa.
Chinese deliveries of medical supplies to Italy have been accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign.
Esper told La Stampa that “Reliance on Chinese 5G vendors ... could render our partners’ critical systems vulnerable to disruption, manipulation, and espionage. It could also jeopardize our communication and intelligence sharing capabilities.”
The United States has been working on the development of an alternative 5G technology solution and encourages its allies to do the same, Esper said. These technologies are being currently tested by the U.S. military, he added.
