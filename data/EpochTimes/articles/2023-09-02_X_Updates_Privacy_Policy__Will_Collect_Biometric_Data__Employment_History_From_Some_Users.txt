Elon Musk’s newly-renamed X platform has said it will begin collecting biometric data and information from some users, including their employment and education history, beginning next month.
“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the updated policy reads.
The updated policy does not define “biometric information” although the term usually pertains to an individual’s physical characteristics such as fingerprints, or facial or retinal measurements. It is also not clear how the platform plans to collect such information.
The Epoch Times has contacted X for further comment.
“To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information,” the policy states. “Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services,” it adds.
According to the policy update, San Francisco-based X also plans to gather information about user’s work and education history for recommendation purposes.
“We may collect and use your personal information (such as your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement, and so on) to recommend potential jobs for you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable employers to find potential candidates, and to show you more relevant advertising,” the privacy policy states.
According to its policy, X uses this information for an array of purposes such as improving and personalizing its products and services “so that you have a better experience on X,” conducting research and surveys, and bolstering the safety and security of its users.
The newly updated policy also notes that X “may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.”
The spokesperson said the biometric data collection will apply to X Premium users, or those who pay for the platform’s monthly subscription service, and will grant them the option to provide their government ID and a picture, to add an additional layer of verification.
Biometric data may be extracted from both for verification purposes, according to the spokesperson.
“This will additionally help us tie, for those that choose, an account to a real person by processing their government-issued ID,” the spokesperson said. “This will also help X fight impersonation attempts and make the platform more secure.”
The Epoch Times has contacted X for further comment regarding the lawsuit.
“The danger is twofold. First, if the use of these markers gets broader adoption, it might establish a system where it becomes virtually impossible to remain anonymous on the net, further eroding the very notion of online privacy,” he said.
The use of such identity markers “will invariably lead to the development of even more fine-tuned and precise methods of targeted advertisement and tailored news distribution,” he continued. “And what this means is that it will become even more difficult for users to acquire a neutral perspective of the web, and eventually, the world. The consequences could be catastrophic.”
“Works on iOS, Android, Mac & PC,” the businessman said. “X is the effective global address book.
“That set of factors is unique,” he added.
