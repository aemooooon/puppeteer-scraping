Beijing’s recent sanctions on U.S. religious freedom officials mark its latest “affront against universal rights” and will only spur further global scrutiny of its human rights violations, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Jan. 10.
The regime’s retaliatory sanctions won’t deter the United States from deploying “all diplomatic and economic tools to promote accountability” over human rights, he added.
“Beijing’s continued attempts to intimidate and silence those speaking out for human rights only contribute to the growing international scrutiny of the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,” Blinken said.
He called on Beijing to “cease its acts of transnational repression, including coercive practices of imprisoning and denying freedom of movement to family members of Uyghur American activists, including individuals serving the American people.”
