Colloquially known as the “Frontpage of the Internet,” Reddit acts as a content sharing and rating website, used for entertainment, discussion, and news aggregation.
With 330 million monthly users, Reddit has been searching for investment this past month by promoting its recent growth figures. Tencent has answered to that search.
Tencent is one of the largest tech companies in China. It not only has holdings in many Western tech companies, but also contributes heavily to the Chinese regime’s censorship and surveillance on the Chinese internet.
There is also irony to Tencent’s participation in Reddit’s funding, as the website, along with popular social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, are blocked by China’s Great Firewall.
Tencent has holdings in many Western companies, and fully owns several online gaming companies.
Some of Tencent’s investments include Elon Musk’s electric car company Tesla; the popular messaging app Snapchat; and Discord, a voice-chat popular among online gamers. It also owns 40 percent of Epic Games, the makers behind the popular online game Fortnite.
Some Western developed games are fully owned by Tencent, such as League of Legends and Clash of Clans. The mobile version of popular multi-player game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is also developed by Tencent.
