With that said, the Air Force is in the process of selecting who will be the prime vendor for this revolutionary, cutting-edge family of systems that will include manned and unmanned aircraft and the systems to support them.
The NGAD will heavily incorporate artificial intelligence, networked sensors, and sensor fusion, and, of course, will depend on software-enabled features to grow and evolve as needs and threats evolve. It will be a system of systems.
In concept, the NGAD will involve multiple manned aircraft, a larger number of closely tied wingman-style collaborative combat aircraft (unmanned aerial vehicles), and advanced command, control, and communication systems.
The collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) will be able to perform with the manned NGAD fighter or act autonomously. CCAs will be configured with a wide variety of weapons and/or sensor packages that will be tailored to the mission. Capability packages with which the CCAs can be configured will include advanced sensors, jamming packages, electronic warfare packages, and weapons that will enable it to execute both air-to-air combat as well as ground attack missions.
