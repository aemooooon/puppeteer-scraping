Wolfpack Research was launched last year by activist short seller Dan David. Its mission is to expose U.S. and foreign publicly listed companies that engage in fraud and other wrongdoings.
Users have to pay for iQiyi’s VIP membership either directly or through partners like e-commerce site JD.com and Xiaomi. Wolfpack alleged that around half of iQiyi’s VIP users got the membership for free or through a cheap deal from these partners. iQiyi accounts for dual memberships on a “gross basis,” which means “it records the full amount of revenue and records its partners’ share as expenses.”
