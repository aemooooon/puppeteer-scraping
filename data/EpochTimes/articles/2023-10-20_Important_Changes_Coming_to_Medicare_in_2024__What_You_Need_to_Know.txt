Big changes are coming to Medicare in 2024. From tax hikes for high earners to expanded telehealth services, America’s seniors should prepare for shifts in health care coverage and costs.
The changes are “good news” for all beneficiaries regarding affordability and coverage, Pavani Rangachari, a professor of health care administration and public health and the director of the Master of Healthcare Administration program at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, told The Epoch Times.
The White House indicates that the increase targets high-paid professionals and wealthy business owners who shield income by classifying it as neither earned nor investment income.
“I think there’s been a lot of recent concern that has come from the federal government in particular, but also consumer advocacy groups, that Medicare Advantage enrollees are often more likely to report trouble affording health care than people on traditional Medicare,” said Loren Anthes, head of external affairs and programs at Yuvo Health, a health care company working with federally qualified health centers.
CMS will require drug companies to pay the government if Part D and Part B drug prices rise faster than inflation, Ms. Rangachari said. This could enable negotiating with pharmacies to stock more generics, helping control costs without reducing access or quality.
“That’s the way to rein in the cost of drugs, which really contributes a lion’s share of the cost of overall health care expenditures,” she said.
After 2024, some accountable care organizations may still offer telehealth, enabling providers to treat patients remotely, regardless of location.
These changes tie to the Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 legislation intended to restrain price increases by decreasing the federal deficit; making prescription medications more affordable; supporting domestic energy production, including clean sources; and other measures.
“The way the benefit is structured now, there’s a full benefit and a partial benefit based upon someone’s income and resources,” Mr. Lipschutz said. “But the partial benefit is being eliminated so that, now, everybody who is eligible for the partial starting next year will be eligible for the full benefit.”
There'll be changes beyond the LIS, Mr. Lipschutz noted.
In 2024, the 5 percent coinsurance requirement for catastrophic coverage under Part D will be eliminated, and out-of-pocket spending will be limited to $2,000 in 2025, he noted.
