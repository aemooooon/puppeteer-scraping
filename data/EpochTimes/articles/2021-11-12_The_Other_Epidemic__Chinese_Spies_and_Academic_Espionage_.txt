There is a genuine fear that Chinese spies are monitoring a number of British universities’ online seminars.
In other words, they are working on vital technology that will serve the CCP.
Of course, British universities aren’t the only ones at risk. In the United States, fears of academic espionage are very much warranted.
The objective of the initiative, launched in 2018, was simple: to combat academic espionage, intellectual property theft, and other serious threats associated with Beijing. Although the professors’ calls are somewhat understandable (after all, if someone is indeed innocent and finds themselves accused of spying on behalf of Beijing, their career is effectively over, even if their name is eventually cleared), the China Initiative is still necessary.
