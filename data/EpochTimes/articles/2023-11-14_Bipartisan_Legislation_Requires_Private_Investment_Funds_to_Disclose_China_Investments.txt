Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Nov. 9 introduced legislation that requires U.S. investment firms to disclose their private equity, hedge funds, and venture capital investments in foreign adversaries, such as China, in an effort to enhance transparency into how U.S. dollars are invested.
The bill, the “Disclosing Investments in Foreign Adversaries Act,” requires private investment funds to inform the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annually of any investments in China and other “countries of concern,” including Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
The legislation also requires the SEC to publish an annual report of private funds that invest in these countries and the percentage of those investments.
Firms offering and selling stock exempt from SEC registration requirements in the private market must also disclose information about the investment’s recipient, the planned destination of the investment, and the intended purpose of the investment.
“Our adversaries, like Communist China, benefit from a complete lack of transparency, allowing them to hide and fund bad behavior—especially when it comes to financial markets,” Mr. Scott said in a statement. “It is time to stop sending American dollars to these countries of concern.”
The American Securities Association and FDD Action, advocacy groups that promote U.S. national security, supported the bill.
The bill is the latest action to track U.S. investments in China amid concerns that U.S. dollars can help the Chinese regime strengthen its military.
