Declining fears over inflation lifted American consumers’ spirits this month.
This was likely a reflection of greater consumer optimism due to easing inflation and the resolution of the debt-ceiling crisis, reported Hsu.
Overall outlook regarding the economy surged 28 percent over the short run and 14 percent over the long run.
The sentiment index is now 28 percent above the historical low from a year ago, and there are signs that it may resume an upward trajectory again.
“As it stands, though, sentiment remains low by historical standards as income expectations softened, said Hsu, adding that ”a majority of consumers still expect difficult times in the economy over the next year.”
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next year tumbled to 3.2 percent in June from 4.2 percent last month, the lowest since March 2021.
The survey’s current conditions index also climbed to a reading of 68.0 from 64.9 in May, while the measure of consumer expectations rose to 61.3 from 55.4 last month.
The Fed has raised interest rates from near zero since March 2022, engaging in its fastest policy-tightening cycle in over 40 years.
