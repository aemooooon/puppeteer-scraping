Israel has never been as technologically and militarily advanced or as economically powerful as it is today. The level of development it has reached in the past couple of decades is impressive by any measure.
Its warfare capabilities are world class—it’s a leader in state-of-the-art military weaponry, guidance systems, cyber warfare, artificial intelligence, and other technologies. The Israeli Air Force is unrivaled in the region, and its intelligence agencies are also among the best in the world.
That reality isn’t lost on the IDF. Just as Israel’s power has increased, so too, has the power, number, and determination of its enemies.
It may soon become the worst of times.
Tehran also funds, arms, and controls several proxy armies. These terror armies are active in Syria and Lebanon, but they’re also in Israel itself, in the south in Gaza and Judea, and in Samaria, as well as in Yemen and Iraq. All are equipped with rockets and large numbers of heavily armed soldiers.
Israelis’ praying on the Temple Mount may not be Turkey’s only “red line” with Israel. Turkey has its eyes on the vast wealth of oil and natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean Sea that Israel controls and sells to Europe.
This intense, internal division projects a sense of weakness and vulnerability to Israel’s enemies, which may in part be considered an invitation to the attacks Israel is experiencing right now. Certainly, there are other factors involved.
