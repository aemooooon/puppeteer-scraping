The Australian government is inviting the people to give opinions on which technologies will be most critical to Australia’s economy and national security over the coming decade.
Businesses and researchers across the country now have six weeks to submit their recommendations for the technologies considered vital for Australia’s interests today or those that have the potential to become critical within the next ten years.
While opening consultations on the List of Critical Technologies in the National Interest, federal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic said the updated list had to put Australia at the forefront of change and promote employment and the country’s reputation as a safe place to invest.
He also said that as Australia needed to identify and understand its strengths and weaknesses, the list of critical technologies would provide focus and form the basis for further discussions on investment and collaboration across all industries.
“This work is also part of our goal to reach 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030, as well as securing our supply chains and promoting Australia as a secure destination of excellence for investment, development and adoption of critical technologies,” Husic said.
At the same time, he mentioned that the Labor government was investing $1 billion (US$690 million) in critical technologies through the National Reconstruction Fund.
