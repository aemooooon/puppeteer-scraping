As the world reels from the pandemic, the Chinese regime has become the leading force in suppressing internet freedom and censoring critical views that challenge the official narrative, according to a report by a U.S.-based think tank.
Freedom on the Net, an annual report by Freedom House that assesses digital surveillance in 65 countries, named Beijing as the worst abuser of digital freedom for the sixth consecutive year.
While online critics have faced charges or arrests in 45 countries over pandemic-related speech, and 28 governments have censored online posts containing unfavorable virus content, “[n]owhere has censorship been more sophisticated and systematic than in China,” according to the report.
Automated deletions, mass content removals and account closures, deployment of trolls, and arrests, along with other policing tools the regime has deployed to tighten control over virus-related information, reflect a surveillance state at its “unprecedented extremes,” the report said.
People.cn, the online version of state media People’s Daily, has supplied automated censorship services to other Chinese websites and apps. Its chairman predicted the censorship industry will grow to employ one million people in three to five years, the report said.
“The party does not solve the problem, but rather attempts to get rid of those who raised the questions,” he said. “And to solve the problem means to control public opinion.”
