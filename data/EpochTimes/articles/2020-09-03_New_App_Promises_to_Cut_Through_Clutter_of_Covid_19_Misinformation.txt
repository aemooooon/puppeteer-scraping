The app, called COVID AllKnowledgeEnable (COVID KE), allows users to receive the most relevant findings and advice, by using its artificial intelligence technology to search for multiple peer-reviewed, medical data sources that come with direct physicians’ insights.
RTM said it draws information only from trusted sources such as the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and overlays these with the latest federal health guidelines.
According to RTM, the European Congress of Radiology reported on July 15, that of the 25,000 articles that have emerged about COVID-19 from various data sources, 48 of them were meta-analyses and only 25 were clinical trials after the data was filtered.
“During this global pandemic, the need for credible, verifiable scientific information and advice is shared by medical professionals, policy-makers and the public, but it’s the public that is facing the biggest threat from misinformation, bad science, and unsound advice,” said Dr. David Koff, RTM’s Chairman and Co-Founder.
“Using the COVID KE app, you’re able to simultaneously scan multiple health data sources from around the world in seconds, which then also combines those findings with the latest recommendations from healthcare professionals around the world to make the best decisions for your family—on the go,” Koff continued.
“We don’t want to replace medical consultation. People still have to talk to their medical physician because each case is different. You cannot cater to all, even if you have the best information,” Koff said.
“What works for you may not work for someone else so you have to still go to your doctor if you are sick.”
The app will be available for download on iPhone, Android and desktop on Sept. 4, said RTM.
