“There remain important gaps in better understanding the crime of OCSE, the perpetrators who use online spaces to lure and abuse children, and the experiences of children in the online spaces that they frequent,” states the report, released by Public Safety Canada on July 31.
“ECPAT recognizes that, despite girls being over-represented as victims of OCSE, boys have historically been overlooked by programs aimed at protecting children or supporting victims.”
ECPAT noted that among its network of 124 organizations, less than five are solely focused on situations where boys are the victim of OCSE.
“While reports of online child exploitation rose dramatically during the COVID pandemic, which caused many to stay in their homes, police have since seen that upward trend continue,” the Mounties said.
According to the RCMP, in 2021 the authorities received over 4,600 total reports, a number that more than doubled in 2022, with over 9,600 total reports received. The situation remains concerning in 2023 as well, with the number of reports during the first three months already surpassing 5,790, indicating a worrisome upward trajectory in OCSE cases.
It noted that these statistics underscore the urgent need for continued vigilance and concerted efforts to curb OCSE to protect the vulnerable from harm in the digital landscape.
“If that rate holds, reports could more than double again for 2023 over last year,” the RCMP said.
“One of these concerns is that technologies make mistakes that can only be corrected by human review and validation,” Public Safety said. “Another concern is that misinformation exists surrounding how technologies affect users when measures to combat OCSE are implemented.”
The department said there needs to be more accountability on the part of the digital industry.
“To address these questions, the digital industry needs to be held accountable when material is uploaded and distributed on their platforms, especially when removal notices have already been issued,” it said.
“The goal is to move from apathy to action so that the industry can take preventative measures in removing material before it is downloaded and further circulated.”
One of the webinars, held in January 2023, shed light on the organized and targeted nature of “sextortion” and emphasized the importance of tailored information and resources for preventing and combating this crime.
According to Public Safety Canada, sextortion involves blackmailing individuals with threats to distribute explicit content unless they pay or provide more sexual material. Financial sextortion, affecting mostly boys aged 15 to 17, involves demands for money to prevent distribution. Sexual sextortion, affecting mostly girls aged 13 to 14, demands more explicit material in exchange for not distributing existing content.
