A senior executive at the non-profit Open AI has warned that, as well as the potential existential threat posed by artificial intelligence (AI), the technology is also “extremely addictive” and that humanity could become “enslaved.”
“With the capability and this enhanced capability comes the other side, the possibility that we design them in the wrong way and they become extremely addictive and we sort of become enslaved to them,” she explained.
The Albanian-born businesswoman also emphasized the need for researchers to identify how people respond to addictive technology to mitigate the potential risks.
“We really don’t know out of the box. We have to discover, we have to learn, and we have to explore,” Ms. Murati explained. “There is a significant risk in making them, developing them wrong, in a way that really doesn’t enhance our lives and in fact it introduces more risk.”
“I think about it in terms of trade-offs: How much value is this technology providing in the real world and how much we mitigate the risks,” she continued.
“This is a unique moment in time where we do have agency in how it shapes society. And it goes both ways: the technology shapes us and we shape it,” she said at the time. “There are a lot of hard problems to figure out. How do you get the model to do the thing that you want it to do, and how you make sure it’s aligned with human intention and ultimately, is in service of humanity?”
