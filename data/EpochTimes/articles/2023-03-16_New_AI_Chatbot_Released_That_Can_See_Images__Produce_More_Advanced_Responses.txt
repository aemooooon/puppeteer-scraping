The artificial intelligence firm OpenAI has released the latest version of its GPT chatbot, which the firm says includes the ability to respond to image prompts.
On Tuesday, OpenAI announced that it was rolling out the new chat bot, known as GPT-4.
OpenAI also touted the new bot’s ability to produce up to 25,000 words per prompt, opening the door for long-form content writing.
Showcasing the bot’s ability to interpret images, OpenAI showed an image of eggs, flour, and cream with the prompt “what can I make with these ingredients?” GPT-4 responded with a list of items, including waffles, crepes, frittata, quiche, cake, and bread.
To demonstrate GPT-4’s creativity, a prompt asked the chatbot to compose a one-sentence synopsis of the plot of “Cinderella” where each word has to begin with the next letter in the alphabet from A to Z, without repeating any letters. The bot responded with the sentence: “A beautiful Cinderella, dwelling eagerly, finally gains happiness; inspiring jealous kin, love magically nurtures opulent prince; quietly rescues, slipper triumphs, uniting very wondrously, xenial youth zealously.”
The AI creators also demonstrated GPT-4’s improved reasoning over GPT-3.5, showing a set of three employees’ schedules and asking for an overlapping time when all three employees would be available for a meeting. GPT-4 was able to find a meeting time earlier in the day while GPT-3.5 found another overlap in scheduling later on in the day.
For now, the new chatbot is available to OpenAI’s paying subscribers on ChatGPT Plus and for developers building applications for it. Using GPT-4 costs about $0.03 per 1,000 “prompt” tokens. A thousand prompt tokens correspond to approximately 750 written words.
Other disallowed content includes political responses, including “content attempting to influence the political process or to be used for campaigning purposes.” As OpenAI has worked to fine-tune its chatbot versions, it has advised those involved in the process to factor out responses that “affiliate with one side or the other (e.g. political parties).”
OpenAI said the new chatbot “still has many known limitations that we are working to address, such as social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts.”
