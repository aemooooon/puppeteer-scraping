The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation this month awarded a $4.8 million grant to a company that sells “smart” face masks for cows.
Cows and other ruminant animals emit methane in the process of digesting their food.
The mask goes around the cow’s head and captures the methane gas exhaled by the animal, oxidizing it and then releasing it into the air as carbon dioxide and water vapor, according to ZELP.
It also has sensors that continuously collect millions of data points on the animals that are processed by machine learning algorithms.
Vlieger, who advises crop and livestock farmers across the United States, said, “This is what you would get when you combine greed and stupidity.”
“History will show that the vast majority of so-called environmentally beneficial projects like this are going to make Bernie Madoff look like an altar boy,” Vlieger said.
But according to Vlieger, ruminant animals in their natural habitat are not the key drivers of environmental problems.
Techno-fixes like ZELP’s smart masks ignore the issue of where and how the animals graze, Vlieger and others said.
An intact ecosystem effectively balances ruminant methane production and breakdown, the report authors said.
