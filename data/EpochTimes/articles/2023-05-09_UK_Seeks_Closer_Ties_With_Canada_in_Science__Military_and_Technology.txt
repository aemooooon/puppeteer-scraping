Britain is seeking closer ties with Canada as it reshapes its foreign policy in the wake of its departure from the European Union.
But British High Commissioner Susannah Goshko says her country is also pushing Ottawa to boost its defence spending.
The United Kingdom updated its national security and foreign policy last month following uncertainty after its exit from the European Union and tumultuous politics under prime ministers Liz Truss and Boris Johnson.
The new plan is looking for expanded connections with Canada on everything from artificial intelligence to sanctions.
Goshko says her country also wants to work to counterbalance rising authoritarianism in regions like the Indo-Pacific and as such is raising its military spending beyond the NATO target of two percent of gross domestic product.
