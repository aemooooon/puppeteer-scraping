President Donald Trump floated the idea that the United States, China, and Russia may come together to discuss collectively cutting back on weaponry investments.
Trump has made it one of his priorities to increase military spending, convincing Congress to approve $700 billion last fiscal year and $716 billion this one. But he also hinted that his reasons had to do with countering the military buildup of China and Russia.
In March, he said one of his priorities for meeting with Putin was “to discuss the arms race, which is getting out of control.”
The United States and the Soviet Union destroyed nearly 2,700 missiles by the treaty’s deadline in 1991.
But for five years, the United States has maintained that the Russian 9M729 missile violates the agreement, as its range exceeds 310 miles.
Ryabkov also accused the United States of violating the treaty by deploying missile defense launchers in Europe, because they can be used to fire offensive missiles too.
However, there’s another problem with the treaty.
The missiles “began their trial service at the airfields of the Southern Military District,” he said, and will be able “to overcome all existing and ... prospective anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems.”
Russia, however, has struggled to maintain its military expansion amid economic woes in recent years.
“The defence budget is now around 10 percent lower than its 2015 peak and is expected to be reduced by a further 5 percent next year,” said principal analyst at IHS Markit Craig Caffrey in December.
Aside from building and militarizing artificial islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, China has been developing a hypersonic missile of its own capable of six times the speed of sound.
In March, Trump announced the United States will form a sixth military branch—the Space Force.
