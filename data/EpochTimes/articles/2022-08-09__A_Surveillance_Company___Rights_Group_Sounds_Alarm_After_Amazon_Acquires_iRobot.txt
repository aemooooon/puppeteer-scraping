Amazon’s $1.7 billion (A$2.4 billion) acquisition deal for iRobot, the creator of Roomba robot vacuums, will give the e-commerce giant another avenue to collect personal information if nothing is done to protect it, Digital Rights Watch warned.
Roombas have a function that collects, creates, and uploads detailed maps of people’s homes, allowing extra functions such as only cleaning a specific room.
“This acquisition isn’t about selling robot vacuums, this is so Amazon can gather even more information about our lives and our homes.
“We should be concerned that any company can have this much information about how we live our lives. Amazon knows a lot about us, and we know very little about them; that kind of asymmetry of power is very concerning for our rights and democracy.”
Clark said personal information should not be treated as an asset for trading and that there should be a limit on how companies can use and share it.
“Imagine a future where Amazon could combine data about your living situation from Roomba, your purchasing habits from Amazon, and your viewing habits on Prime video to determine your risk profile to adjust your insurance premiums,” he said.
An Amazon spokesperson told The Epoch Times that protecting customer data has always been “incredibly important” to the company and it believes it has been “very good stewards” of data.
“Customer trust is something we have worked hard to earn—and work hard to keep—every day,” the spokesperson said.
