Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) applauded the Pentagon’s decision to issue a list of Chinese companies that are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
The companies include telecom giant Huawei, mobile operators China Mobile and China Telecom, rail car manufacturer CRRC, video surveillance manufacturer Hikvision, shipbuilding companies CSIC and CSSC, aerospace firm AVIC, defense company Norinco, and cloud computing and data-center company Inspur.
“We urge the President to impose economic penalties against these Chinese military firms,” Cotton and Gallagher said in the press release.
The White House didn’t comment about whether it would sanction the listed firms.
Hikvision told Reuters that it isn’t a “Chinese military company” and would work with the U.S. government to resolve any concerns.
Trump added that the U.S. secretary of state should consider whether Chinese nationals currently on F or J visas should have their visas revoked.
Cotton and Gallagher added that “Congress should update this 1999 law to better address the present-day challenges posed by China’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy,” in their statement.
