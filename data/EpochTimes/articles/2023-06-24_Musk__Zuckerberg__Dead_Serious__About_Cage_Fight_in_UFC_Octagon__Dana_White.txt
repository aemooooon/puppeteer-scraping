Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg and billionaire businessman Elon Musk are “absolutely dead serious” about a cage match in a UFC Octagon, according to UFC President Dana White.
“Talked with Mark and Elon last night, both guys are absolutely dead serious about this,” White said. “They both said, ‘Yeah, we’ll do it.' They both want to do it,” he added.
White said he expects the fight “would be the biggest fight ever in the history of the world, bigger than anything that’s ever been done,” and would bring in hundreds of millions of dollars that would likely go to charity.
“It would break all pay-per-view records. These guys would raise hundreds of millions of dollars for charity. You don’t have to be a fighting fan to be interested in this fight. Everybody would want to see it,” the UFC president continued.
White noted that the biggest fight of all time was Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor. That fight took place in 2017 and Mayweather defeated his rival.
“I just think it triples that. I think it triples what that did. There’s no limit on what that thing can make … Everybody would watch it, everybody would want to see it,” White said of a potential spar between Zuckerberg and Musk.
Meta chief product officer Chris Cox said during a companywide meeting earlier this month that the app was a direct response to Twitter, adding that the company has been “hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, that they believe that they can trust and rely upon for distribution,” the publication reported.
As news of the yet-to-be-unveiled app appeared on social media, SpaceX chief Musk weighed in when some Twitter users pointed out that Zuckerberg practices Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ).
However, Owain Flanders, news editor at VegasSlotsOnline.com, put the odds at 3-to-2 in favor of Musk.
