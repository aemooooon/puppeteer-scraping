Chang Po-yang, communications director of the Taiwan Statebuilding Party, said that YouTube’s censorship poses a great threat to American democracy and freedom of speech.
Chang pointed out that when YouTube and other social media platforms first emerged, ordinary people could freely disseminate information for free. However, these tech giants have now formed “a new monopoly of discourse,” controlling people’s access to information, he said.
He also noted that while YouTube wants election fraud-related videos removed, it has allowed the Chinese regime’s political propaganda videos to remain on the platform. He added that governments should enact regulations that hold tech companies accountable when they censor out information.
U.S.-based current affairs commentator Li Zhengkuan expressed his concerns that YouTube’s parent company, Google, has a history of aligning with the Chinese regime.
