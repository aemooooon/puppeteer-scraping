Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, has been reinstated as CEO of the artificial intelligence (AI) tech company, just days after his shock firing, capping off a turbulent few days.
Mr. Altman will return as CEO alongside a new board initially chaired by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and current board member Adam D'Angelo, co-founder of Quora.
“We are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this,” OpenAI said.
Officials also claimed Mr. Altman had not been “consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” although they stopped short of providing further details regarding his ousting.
At the time, Microsoft said it remained a partner with OpenAI despite the management shuffle.
“I love OpenAI and everything I’ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together. When I decided to join msft [Microsoft] on sun evening, it was clear that was the best path for me and the team,” he wrote.
“With the new board and w [with] Satya’s [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] support, I’m looking forward to returning to OpenAI and building on our strong partnership with msft,” the tech entrepreneur wrote.
Mr. Nadella also welcomed Mr. Altman’s return as CEO in a post on X Tuesday, writing that the tech giant is “encouraged” by the latest changes to the OpenAI board.
Mr. Brockman, who had also joined Microsoft in the wake of the turbulence at OpenAI, said he would be getting straight back to coding.
