Potential short squeeze plays gained steam in 2021, with new retail traders looking for the next huge move.
A short squeeze can occur when a heavily shorted stock rises in value instead of falling. Short sellers could be looking to close out their position and can face a loss if they have to buy back the shares they initially borrowed at a higher price.
The stock would have ranked first on the leaderboard if not for the fact that shares have gone down in value over the last week. Fintel notes that a short squeeze and margin calls are less likely when the share price is going down. If shares increase to start the week, PIK could be a strong target for a short squeeze and receive more social media mentions.
