A Chinese national pleaded guilty on Monday to conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with laundering more than $4 million in drug proceeds generated by large-scale cocaine trafficking in the United States.
Wu repatriated the funds illegally obtained by Latin American drug trafficking organizations to Mexico by passing them through a complex series of financial transactions to hide their criminal origin, according to the statement.
He was given a percentage of the money he laundered as compensation for organizing these shady dealings. Much of the money he handled came from cocaine trafficking within the Eastern District of Virginia, the department said.
Wu is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 29, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, said the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s statement. A federal district court judge will determine the actual sentence but sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties, according to this statement.
Information technology powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data provides effective tools to analyze financial transactions that can detect money laundering patterns.
The first step, called placement, is to put illicit profits into the legitimate financial system. It can be accomplished via bank deposits, money transfers, purchasing money orders, or funneled via a business owned by a criminal organization like a casino, for example.
Once the funds enter the financial systems, a technique called layering is used to hide the source of money. The placed funds can then be transferred several times between banks in several countries, or used for loans.
