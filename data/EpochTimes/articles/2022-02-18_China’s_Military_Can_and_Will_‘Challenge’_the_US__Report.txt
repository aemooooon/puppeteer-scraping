“China is increasingly assertive and the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system,” the report reads.
“Today, China has transformed what was an obsolete military into one that can challenge the U.S. military across the spectrum of conventional and unconventional capabilities.”
The report states that the Pentagon recognized China as a “pacing threat” in most areas, but that the communist regime was still vulnerable to territorial disputes and the pressures associated with a developing economy.
There were several ways in which the Department of Defense (DoD) failed to adequately respond to these developments, the report found.
“Amidst this backdrop, successful preparation for strategic competition with China will depend on continuing efforts to increase U.S. combat credibility and enhance conventional deterrence that can help prevent conflict, protect U.S. interests, and assure allies,” the report states.
The recommendation, however, is not supported by everyone.
However the United States proceeds, the report said that the CCP would continue to be a threat for the foreseeable future.
