A commissioner for the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) has said that the government must compel tech companies to moderate more content in order to prevent the spread of artificial intelligence-driven election disinformation.
Big Tech companies are creating a monster in AI that will unleash havoc on the U.S. electoral system, FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said at the June 27 Collision tech conference.
“For business reasons, the tech companies created this monster,” Weintraub said.
Because the U.S. government is constitutionally barred from controlling speech and the press, Weintraub said, it would need to compel tech companies to adopt more strict “content moderation” policies to prevent the spread of misinformation.
This is particularly true in the age of AI, Weintraub said, saying that the “explosion of AI” would have profound effects on the electoral process, as “deepfakes” and false information proliferate throughout the media ecosystem.
To that end, Weintraub said that the tech companies controlling social media will have to “tame” the monster they created by reestablishing content moderation policies such as those used in the 2016 presidential election to thwart reported foreign election interference.
Only through a “whole of society effort,” with government and corporations working toward the same goal, might the “virality” of false information be combatted, Weintraub said.
The United States is no exception to this trend. The websites for numerous government departments, ranging from the Office of the Surgeon General to the Department of Homeland Security to the Food and Drug Administration, all now house dedicated pages and multimedia content lamenting the rise of misinformation and disinformation.
Some websites, including the FDA’s, portray misinformation as a virus not unlike the one that causes COVID-19, even going so far as to encourage Americans to “stop the spread.”
The nation’s recent experiences with government-backed content moderation are far from utopian, however. The executive branch currently faces multiple probes into alleged unconstitutional behavior across administrations including the use of content moderation policies as a tool for censorship and surveillance.
According to the report, a division of the Department of Homeland Security illicitly expanded its mission to censor and surveil U.S. citizens by coordinating with social media companies and pressuring those companies to moderate content in favor of the administration.
“CISA metastasized into the nerve center of the federal government’s domestic surveillance and censorship operations on social media,” the report reads. “By 2020, CISA routinely reported social media posts that allegedly spread ‘disinformation’ to social media platforms.
As a result, government overreach may hamper efforts to focus on real misinformation threats by giving the public the impression that a vast, unelected bureaucracy is using misinformation as a bogeyman to maintain power.
The FEC is one such example. While FEC commissioners are elected to a six-year term, Weintraub herself has served for 21 years because of congressional and executive failures to nominate a replacement. Likewise, the FEC’s mandate to uphold election finance law is only tangentially related to the issue of misinformation.
