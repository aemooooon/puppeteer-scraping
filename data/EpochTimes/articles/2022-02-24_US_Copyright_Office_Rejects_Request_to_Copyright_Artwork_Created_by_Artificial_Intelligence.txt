The two-dimensional artwork is titled “A Recent Entrance to Paradise” and was created by an AI, which Thaler, who majored Summa Cum Laude in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Russian at Westminster College, refers to as the “Creativity Machine.”
Thaler initially filed an application to register a copyright claim in the artwork on Nov. 3, 2018, stating that it was “autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine” and that he was “seeking to register this computer-generated work as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine.”
However, a Copyright Office registration specialist in 2019 refused to register the claim on the basis that it “lacks the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.”
Undeterred, Thaler subsequently requested that the Copyright Office reconsider its initial refusal, claiming that “the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by either statute or case law.”
But the office, after reviewing the artwork again, refused the reconsideration because the artwork “lacked the required human authorship necessary to sustain a claim in copyright,” and because Thaler had “provided no evidence on sufficient creative input or intervention by a human author in the Work.”
The office also stated that it would not “abandon its longstanding interpretation of the Copyright Act, Supreme Court, and lower court judicial precedent that a work meets the legal and formal requirements of copyright protection only if it is created by a human author.”
“The office will not register works ‘produced by a machine or mere mechanical process’ that operates ’without any creative input or intervention from a human author‘ because, under the statute, ’a work must be created by a human being,'” the review board said.
“So Thaler must either provide evidence that the Work is the product of human authorship or convince the Office to depart from a century of copyright jurisprudence. He has done neither,” the board added.
