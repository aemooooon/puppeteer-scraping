Ryan Smith is the founder of TruDiagnostic, a commercial testing system that tests your biological age, as opposed to your chronological age. It’s can be a profoundly useful tool, because you need an objective barometer to tell you whether or not the things you’re doing to improve your health are actually having the desired impact.
“We saw some really interesting things as it related to COVID-19 and aging,” Smith says. The first thing they noticed was telomere length shortening. Several studies have now demonstrated that telomere length decreases with COVID exposure.
Now, your body has mechanisms to replenish Vsels. It’s one of the strategies your body uses to stay healthy. Vsels are extracted from your peripheral blood, unlike regular stem cells, assuming that they’re autologous, which means they’re from your own body. They’re not taken from your bone marrow or your fat tissue, which are the two most common sources for stem cells.
Senolytics selectively identify these senescent cells and destroy them. That’s what senolytic therapy means. “Seno” meaning it’s the senescent cell and “lytic” means that lyses, i.e., destroys, it.
Another interesting technique is called plasma exchange apheresis. This arose from studies in which the vascular systems of old and young mice were interconnected so that the mice started sharing blood with each other. Curiously, the older mice experienced a rejuvenating effect, and the younger mice experienced more rapid aging.
