The Hong Kong government recently admitted that its contact tracing mobile app LeaveHomeSafe contains a facial recognition function. However, the authorities claimed that they didn’t know about it before and had never used the feature.
Hong Kong residents have had concerns since the introduction of LeaveHomeSafe. Many have expressed fear of it becoming the government’s tool for implementing stricter social control or infringing on people’s privacy.
Wong Ho-wa, a Hong Kong data scientist and pro-democracy activist, said the government should make the app’s source code available to the public to mitigate public concerns.
Antony Leung, a senior media professional in Hong Kong, said the contact tracing app pushed by the city’s government appeared awfully similar to mainland China’s “social credit system,” a system that utilizes artificial intelligence and facial recognition to conduct mass surveillance and assign points on citizens’ behavior.
LeaveHomeSafe was designed primarily to track the user’s whereabouts amid the pandemic, among other features. The Hong Kong government claims that the app is only used for COVID-19 prevention. It requires all private citizens and public officials to download the app in order to enter certain government buildings, public hospitals, and supermarkets, starting on Nov. 1, 2021.
The converted source file comprises some 20 folders. One of those, named org, contains a subfolder named reactnative, which further consists of three folders titled facedetector, camera, and maskedview, respectively, according to the report.
One of the java files, known originally as “FaceDetectorUtils.java” but renamed “a.java” in LeaveHomeSafe, could be used to detect the position of a person’s mouth, nose, left and right cheeks, eyes, ears, and earlobes. It can also detect the degree of a head tilt and calculate the probability that someone is smiling or has both eyes open.
However, Wong, the data scientist based in Hong Kong, told The Epoch Times that it is impossible to know whether the facial recognition function has been used judging by the source code alone. And that the source code disassembled and examined by FactWire was only a part of the complete application.
