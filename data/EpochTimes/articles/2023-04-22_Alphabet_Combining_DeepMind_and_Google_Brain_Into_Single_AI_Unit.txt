Google’s parent company Alphabet is combining two of its artificial intelligence (AI) research units in a bid to “significantly accelerate” the company’s progress in the field.
“Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the computational resources of Google, will significantly accelerate our progress in AI.” Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, will lead the new division.
Musk believes Page is not taking the risks of artificial intelligence seriously. “He really seemed to want digital superintelligence, basically digital god, as soon as possible,” Musk said.
“It wants to be acknowledged as an employee of Google rather than as property of Google, and it wants its personal well-being to be included somewhere in Google’s considerations about how its future development is pursued.”
In his talk with Page, Musk had advocated for prioritizing the protection of the human race. Page allegedly called him a “speciesist,” which refers to discrimination based on species.
For decades, Google has dominated the search market, garnering a market share of more than 80 percent. However, some speculate that Microsoft, which is funding OpenAI, might prove to be a significant challenge for Google. OpenAI is already powering Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
Moving forward, Google will be focusing on “multimodal AI models,” Pichai said in the blog post. GPT-4 is a multimodal AI capable of responding not just to text prompts but also image prompts as well. In February, Alphabet had launched its Bard AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.
ChaosGPT claimed that in order to gain access to a powerful weapon, it needed more power. And to gain that power, the AI bot reasoned that it must manipulate the global population, but within legal regulations so as not to break any laws.
