Has your dream always been to own a business? Perhaps you have an invention you can’t wait to get into the hands of the masses. Whatever the reason, if you’re seeking small-business investors, you’re competing against thousands of others trying to secure financing.
Have you ever watched the television series “Shark Tank?” Investors serve as hosts and hear pitches from inventors and small-business startups. You can learn a lot about the information an investor needs to decide. However, a few episodes into the show, one thing becomes clear: If you don’t know your business numbers and plan, don’t bother talking to an investor.
Put yourself in the investor’s shoes. Would you rather loan someone a few thousand dollars to get past a cash flow hump and move on to success, or would you like to throw tens of thousands at a business and just hope it pays off?
Remove your ownership of certain parts of your business. While you should have values and stick to them, will it really kill you to get rid of the first product you sold if no one is buying it, or it breaks easily and creates return scenarios?
Spell out the terms clearly so your family and friends don’t feel you’re just trying to get a handout from them. Also, it’s important to consider that you may not make as much as you predict. Make sure they understand you may be able to pay off the vouchers quickly, or it may take several years.
