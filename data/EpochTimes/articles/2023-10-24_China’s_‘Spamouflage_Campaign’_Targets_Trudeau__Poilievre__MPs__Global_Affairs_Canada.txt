Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, and dozens of Canadian MPs have been targeted by a “spamouflage” campaign coming from China, said Global Affairs Canada (GAC).
“This campaign targeted dozens of MPs from across the political spectrum and spanning multiple geographic regions of Canada, including the Prime Minister, the leader of the Official Opposition, and several members of Cabinet,” the statement said.
According to the GAC, spamouflage is a tactic that employs networks of recently created or compromised social media accounts to disseminate and magnify propaganda messages across various platforms. RRM Canada’s analysis indicates that the bot network in question may be affiliated with the widely recognized spamouflage network that has been publicly reported by companies such as Meta and Microsoft, as well as by threat intelligence experts who have linked its activities to China.
The recently detected spam comments alleged that a critic of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Canada had accused multiple MPs of engaging in criminal and ethical misconduct. Notably, the GAC warned that the spamouflage campaign likely involved the use of “deepfake” videos, digitally altered by artificial intelligence, to specifically target the Canadian officials.
RRM Canada, which supports the country’s efforts in countering foreign state-sponsored disinformation, said one of the primary objectives of the spamouflage operation is likely to tarnish the reputation of targeted MPs. The strategy includes spreading what appear to be authentic posts, including videos, making allegations of impropriety against these MPs. Notably, the campaign also involves the use of a well-known Chinese-speaking figure in Canada to amplify these claims.
