China has made the “aligning of civil and defense technology development” a national priority.
These capabilities rely heavily on so-called fourth-industrial (4IR) technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning, big data, quantum computing, and the like.
This dependency on commercial technologies has, in turn, raised the importance of “military-civil fusion” (MCF). It has become an essential ingredient in Beijing’s long-term strategic effort to make China a technological superpower, in both military and civilian respects.
Beijing is pursuing a two-pronged innovation approach to MCF, first, by fostering research and development in critical, commercial 4IR technologies, and then promoting the spin-off of these technologies to the military sector.
It should come as no surprise, therefore, to see that MCF has intertwined military modernization with civilian technological innovation in a number of critical dual-use technology sectors, including aerospace, advanced equipment manufacturing, AI, and alternative sources of energy.
In 2017, Beijing created the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, a new powerful body for overseeing MCF strategy and implementation.
China has laid out a particularly ambitious program for it to lead the world in AI by 2030. In July 2017, Beijing released its “New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.” This plan has three main strategic goals: first, to bring China’s AI sector up to the level of the global state-of-the-art; second, to achieve major breakthroughs in terms of basic AI theory by 2025; and third, by 2030, make China the global leader in AI theory, technology and application, as well as the major AI innovation center of the world.
In addition, China’s Central Military Commission created a Scientific Research Steering Committee, which functions largely along the lines of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This agency is intended to fuel technological innovation and the development of advanced technologies that might have military applications. The Scientific Research Steering Committee is part of a “new ‘top-level architecture’ of China’s military technology innovation system.”
Moreover, Beijing has greatly expanded funding of science and technology pertaining to 4IR technologies, particularly AI. China is building and training a new generation of AI engineers in new AI hubs, particularly through the support of “national champions” such as Huawei, Baidu, and Alibaba. Finally, it is carrying out a “centrally directed systematic plan” to extract 4IR knowledge (especially AI) from abroad through talent recruitment, technology transfer, investments, and even espionage.
These initiatives and new organizations are intricately tied to the modernization of the PLA and its eventual mastery of intelligentized warfare. AI, in particular, is explicitly linked to national defense construction, security assessment, and control capabilities. Ultimately, the aim is to “inject AI” into nearly every aspect of the PLA’s table of equipment and inventory of operational systems.
China is only at the beginning of an arduous, multi-year (multi-decade, even) effort to harness commercial high technologies for the technological advancement of the PLA. The barriers to the widespread development and diffusion of many 4IR technologies to the military sector remain high. There is no certainty that Xi Jinping’s MCF initiatives will work any better than early civil-military integration (CMI) efforts.
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Xi, the Chinese Communist Party, and the PLA will walk away from the 4IR or the MCF anytime soon, even if they do experience setbacks. Beijing particularly believes that advances in AI will fundamentally reshape military and economic competition in the coming decades, and it is shaping its long-term plans accordingly. In particular, it is providing “significant” government subsidies to tech firms and academic institutions that engage in cutting-edge AI research.
