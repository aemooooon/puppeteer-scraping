AI dystopian narratives tend to center around farfetched scenarios involving sentient robots running amok, quite literally destroying humanity. In truth, instead of “wiping us out” in one violent swoop, the AI revolution is likely to be a more drawn-out—and considerably less bloody—affair. Nevertheless, the effects will be profound, and the vast majority of humans will be affected.
It’s very possible that AI could result in job displacement throughout the world, without the creation of new career paths. AI is, after all, the first technology in human existence that’s designed to remove many, if not all, of us from the human equation.
Don’t expect decision-makers to save you.
In short, according to Axios’s sources, corporations are refraining from regulating AI because they’ve invested (and continue to invest) vast amounts of money in arguably the most significant technological creation in history. As for the government, Congress is simply too divided to address the intricacies of AI regulation during an election year, according to Axios.
