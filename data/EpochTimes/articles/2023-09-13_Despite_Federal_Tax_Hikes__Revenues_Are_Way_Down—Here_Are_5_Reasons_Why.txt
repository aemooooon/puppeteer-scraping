The fact that the government raises taxes doesn’t necessarily mean it will raise more revenues. The Biden administration is discovering that the hard way.
On paper, that adds up to more than $60 billion in tax hikes in 2023.
It’s too early to fully account for why tax revenues are down in 2023. However, there are some factors that are clearly at work, even if it’s unclear how much of the drop in tax receipts each factor explains.
But the IRS and the Biden administration have also been playing fast and loose with regulatory interpretations of the new tax provisions. By devising expansive definitions for certain terms written in the statute, the IRS has greatly expanded the size of some of the green tax credits.
In one of numerous egregious examples, the IRS wrote regulations that allow foreign vehicles to circumvent strict domestic-production and battery-content requirements by defining “commercial vehicles” to include any vehicles that are leased, including to consumers.
The ERC is a refundable federal tax credit that was created in March 2020. It was designed to pay certain employers whose businesses were disrupted by government shutdowns if they kept employees on payroll.
While it may have been well-intended, implementation of the ERC has proven disastrous, delivering more fraud and abuse than pandemic relief.
Even though the ERC expired after 2021, claims have since skyrocketed, with ERC companies pushing businesses to file forms to retroactively change prior tax filings.
More ERC claims continue to pour in even now, long after the pandemic.
