President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that outlines the federal government’s priorities for handling artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.
The order promises more tax dollars for AI research and development (R&D) and more access to federal data sets for AI testing. It also calls for establishing a regulatory framework and technical standards for AI and for protecting American AI from acquisition by competitors and adversaries. Further, it asks NASA, the Defense Department, and other agencies to dedicate more of their supercomputer resources to AI and asks federal agencies to promote education in the AI field.
Agencies should review their data and models to see where they can increase access to AI researchers and developers “while protecting safety, security, privacy, and confidentiality.” The agencies should also use feedback from the AI R&D community and the public to improve access “and quality of AI data and models.”
The memo will “inform the development of regulatory and non‑regulatory approaches” to technologies and industries either empowered or enabled by AI “that advance American innovation while upholding civil liberties, privacy, and American values.”
The memo will also “consider ways to reduce barriers to the use of AI technologies in order to promote their innovative application while protecting civil liberties, privacy, American values, and United States economic and national security.”
The memo will be open to public comment.
Agencies involved in regulation will then have 180 days to get back to Mulvaney with plans on how to bring their regulatory regimes in line with the memo.
Trump also issued a national security memo on Feb. 11, that gives his national security adviser, John Bolton, 120 days to “organize the development of an action plan to protect the United States advantage in AI and AI technology critical to United States economic and national security interests against strategic competitors and adversarial nations.“
