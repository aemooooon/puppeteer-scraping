Canada is one of the few countries in the world that does not have access to Google’s new artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot Bard, as the company’s war of words with the federal government over the Online News Act drags on.
Google announced in a blog post on July 13 that it was expanding Bard to 230 countries and territories, but Canada is absent from that list. Other countries that have been left out include Russia, China, and North Korea.
When asked why Canada was left out of the launch, a Google spokesperson told The Epoch Times: “As we continue to build Bard responsibly, we’re expanding access to more countries and regions in multiple languages. We’re committed to being good partners as we work through regulatory uncertainty in Canada, and we’re enthusiastic about bringing Bard’s generative AI potential to Canadians soon.”
Bard was only available in the United States and the United Kingdom when it first launched back in March. The launch of Bard in the European Union was delayed back in June due to Google failing to answer privacy concerns from the Irish Data Protection Commission, but that has since been addressed.
AI chatbots like Bard, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Bing allow users to interact with them in a conversational manner, with the AI then providing answers to their queries. This can result in the chatbots writing essays, planning vacations, sharing recipes, and much more.
Google said the Liberal government had failed to give assurances that the regulatory process would be able to resolve structural issues in its legislation. On June 22, Meta also said that Canadians would lose access to news on its social media sites due to the Online News Act.
