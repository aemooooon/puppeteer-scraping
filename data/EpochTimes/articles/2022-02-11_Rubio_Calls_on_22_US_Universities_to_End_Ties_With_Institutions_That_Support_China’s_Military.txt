Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has urged 22 American universities to end their academic and research partnerships with Chinese schools that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has tasked with supporting Beijing’s military modernization.
“For decades, Beijing has openly exploited the expertise of Chinese students and scholars studying or conducting research in the United States to accelerate the PRC’s economic and military development,” the letters read, referring to the country’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.
The letters were addressed to 22 U.S. universities, which have entered into academic or research partnerships with Chinese universities that are charged with implementing the CCP’s military-civil fusion (MCF) strategy. The state-led strategy seeks to harness civilian-developed research and technology to aid China’s military modernization, thus blurring the line between civilian and military sectors.
A 2018 report by think tank Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) showed that the PLA sent more than 2,500 Chinese scientists to train and work in overseas universities from 2007 to 2017. Some of those scientists were under civilian cover, but all were sent to “gain skills and knowledge of value to the Chinese military” and “are believed to be party members who returned to China when instructed,” the report stated.
“The PRC is fully integrating Chinese private industry and the PRC’s civilian universities into their MCF strategy,” read the letter.
Last December, Lieber was found guilty by a U.S. jury on all six counts relating to lying about his funding received from Chinese institutions as part of a state-sponsored recruitment program called the Thousand Talents Plan.
At least 68 civilian universities in China have been officially described as part of the regime’s defense system or supervised by the regime’s defense industry agency, ASPI found.
