And perhaps most important, the SDI system became the greatest bargaining chip in Reagan’s possession for negotiations with the Soviets, who were deeply afraid that they could never have the resources or technology to create their own defensive shield, thus rendering their entire nuclear weapons arsenal useless.
Modern presidents like Barack Obama and Joe Biden would do well to study Reagan’s negotiating successes before they pursued, or continue to pursue, deals with Iran or Russia. After Reagan walked away from the deal in Reykjavik, Gorbachev worked hard to catch up to America’s technological advantage, which led to the Soviet Union’s eventual collapse. But it also pressured Gorbachev to come to the table once again only a year later to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which Gorbachev agreed to only after realizing that Reagan was never going to drop the SDI.
