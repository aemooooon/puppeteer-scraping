Cocaine. Meth. Heroin. Even the most sheltered among us recognize the names of these infamous illegal drugs. The “Don’t do drugs” mantra has been repeated with gritty persistence since my own days in elementary school.
Yet now, in this day of clever counterfeits, we would do well to heed Apostle Paul’s warning in 2 Corinthians 11:14: “Satan masquerades as an angel of light.”
Indeed.
There are many street names for synthetic cannabis, but the most popular are “K2” and “spice.” The “spice” name probably came from the practice of labeling the packages as harmless “potpourri.”
Dr. Fred Kinnicutt, a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist in Eugene, Oregon, states, “Research studies show if kids under the age of 16 use marijuana, real or synthetic, on a regular basis, they will lose 10 IQ points by the time they are adults.” Kinnicutt also describes what he has seen in the past two to three years in his own office and the psychiatric hospital due to cannabinoids: “I’m definitely seeing an increase in psychosis—adults and kids being removed from reality, hearing voices, seeing things not there, or delusional thinking. They are very impaired. And signs of psychosis can still be present even a year later after stopping marijuana use.”
Mark vaped spice only a few times, but the effects were strong enough to send him to the hospital a year and a half later with signs of psychosis. And multiple trips to local emergency rooms did little to help. In fact, it was Mark’s confession to his dad, not the hospital, that finally revealed the probable cause of his health issues.
In Mark’s case, because his symptom was psychosis, Norris explained that standard hospital protocol was only a temporary fix. Before Mark’s admission concerning spice, he was promptly put on an anti-psychotic medication to sedate him. Once he rested and was calm, a post-discharge treatment plan (which was simply to see a counselor) was discussed, and then out the door he was shuffled. Thankfully, Mark is doing better with the appropriate treatment. Still, hospitals must better identify and treat health problems related to synthetic weed.
Despite police efforts to crack down on these substances, manufacturers use the law to their advantage. As a result, chemical substances deemed illegal are slightly changed, and the new, legal products flood the market. In years past, it would take months for officials to identify these new substances, label them illegal, then start the now-tardy process of enforcement. But, in November 2021, officers received a much-needed new weapon in this ongoing battle.
