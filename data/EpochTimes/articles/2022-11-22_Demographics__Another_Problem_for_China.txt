As Communist Party leader Xi Jinping begins an unprecedented third term with a team of loyalists, China faces an array of economic problems—financial strains, a collapse of the property sector, and the ill effects of COVID-19 lockdowns, just to name three currently attention-grabbing headlines.
China’s worker problem had its inception decades ago when Deng Xiaoping promulgated his one-child policy. Back then, China had a labor surplus. Some 90 percent of the population was of working age. Those eager hands and minds helped propel the fabulous growth that Deng’s market reforms permitted. But the one-child policy so constrained birth rates that by the 1990s, the flow of young people into the workforce began to ebb. By 2015, matters had become acute. In response, Beijing eventually eased the one-child policy. But it seems that the habits formed in previous decades kept birth rates low despite the change in the law. Even in the unlikely event that birth rates would pick up, it would take 15-20 years for these new births to make a difference in the workforce. In the meantime, the worker shortage promises to become more acute.
