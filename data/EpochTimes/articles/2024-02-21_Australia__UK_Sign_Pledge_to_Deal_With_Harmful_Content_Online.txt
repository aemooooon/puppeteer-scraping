Australia has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Kingdom to strengthen the cooperation between the two countries on online safety and security.
The Australian government said the MoU would amplify online safety laws in both countries, and help develop a “global consensus” on how to deal with online harm.
“Working together, we will protect the privacy, safety, and security of our citizens without stifling the innovation that is vital for economic, social and individual progress.
While Ms. Rowland noted that online safety was a shared international responsibility, she said the two countries needed to be proactive in developing proper legislative frameworks to address emerging online risks.
“Both Australia and the United Kingdom are resolute in our commitment to keeping our citizens safe online,” she said.
“We are like-minded allies and key partners in the fight for safer and more positive online experiences.”
Meanwhile, Michelle Donelan, the UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, said the MoU signified a new chapter in the history of the two countries.
More cooperation will come in the form of in-person dialogues, coordinated bilateral and multilateral engagement, regulatory engagement, and shared research projects.
Australia has been subject to a series of serious cyber attacks that rocked the country since September 2022.
In December 2023, the government introduced the digital ID legislation to the federal parliament, which provides a formal legislative framework for Australians to verify their identity online via a single platform.
