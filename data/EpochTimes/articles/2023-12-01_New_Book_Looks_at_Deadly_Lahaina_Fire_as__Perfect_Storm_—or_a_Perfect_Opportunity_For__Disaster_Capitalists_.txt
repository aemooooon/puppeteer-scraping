Nearly four months after the deadly Lahaina fire on the island of Maui, a new book explores whether the tragedy was the result of natural causes, gross negligence, or more “nefarious” motives.
“What significance is the Smart City planning in relation to this tragedy?” the book asks, and offers the following conjecture: “Might this and other wildfires be paving the way for the destruction of a city in order to build ‘15-minutes cities?’”
The authors say many residents believe that the fire was an opportunity for predatory “disaster capitalists” to acquire their destroyed property at low prices.
Within days of the fire, several residents who lost their homes reported receiving offers to buy over the phone. This fact led the authors to question whether a larger plan might be in place for wealthy individuals to buy up land which many residents regard as sacred.
