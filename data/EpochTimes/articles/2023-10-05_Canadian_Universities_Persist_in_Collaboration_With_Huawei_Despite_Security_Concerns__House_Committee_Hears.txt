Canadian universities are continuing research collaborations with Chinese institutions despite government efforts to impose stronger measures against potential technology transfer to the regime and address related national security concerns, the House of Commons science committee heard.
“I discovered that as recently as a few weeks ago, there have been new patent applications published, listing Huawei as owner, with Canadian university researchers as inventors, including those from the University of Toronto, UBC, Queens, Ottawa, McMaster, and Western,” he said.
While China was not directly named in the document, Ms. Karaskova emphasized during her testimony at the House science committee that this move signifies the European Union’s active engagement rather than passive observation in the geopolitical competition.
“China’s global reach, far-reaching goals, increasingly revisionist agenda, and the nature of its political regime, make it a risk and a challenge like no other,” she said.
“Europe as well as Canada and other like-minded countries would have to ensure that they stay competitive. Especially in the field of emerging technologies, research funding needs to ensure that the most promising activities stay domestic.”
