U.S. officials recently introduced legislation to address China’s human rights violations in the Xinjiang region.
On March 12, U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) proposed a new bill, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act, which would require U.S.-traded companies that do business in Xinjiang to review and disclose information about their supply chains—particularly whether their products are made by forced labor or sourced from internment camps.
Among the 83 brands named in the report were Adidas, Apple, Gap, Huawei, Nike, and Samsung.
“American companies should not be complicit in China’s abuse of its Muslim minorities. This legislation will help shine a light on these inhumane practices and provide needed transparency for investors,” Wexton said.
