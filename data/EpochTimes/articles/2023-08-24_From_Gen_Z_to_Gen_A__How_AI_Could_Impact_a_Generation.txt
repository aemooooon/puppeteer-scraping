The next generation, Generation Alpha, or Generation AI, is likely to be much worse.
Those born between 2012 and the mid-2020s will grow up in a world where AI assistants—think Alexa on steroids—will reign supreme.
Martyn Briggs, lead author of the report, warned that we, as a society, “are at the dawn of a demographic ‘Gen A’ revolution.” No longer will Gen Z be viewed as “the most disruptive generation,” he said, because the “kids of today will have AI models that grow with them.”
It’s very likely that Gen Aers will turn to these AI models for advice on everything imaginable, from homework and dietary habits to career choices and potential life partners. In other words, these extremely advanced AI models could take the role of friends and family. They could become a sort of one-stop shop for advice, guidance, and reassurance.
The Fortune piece quoted Timothy Papandreou, an adviser to Alphabet’s research and development organization, X (formerly GoogleX), who recently outlined the many ways in which children will “have an AI avatar shadow assistant or agent from birth.”
“As they grow, AI will grow with them and know everything it needs to know, and always be there as a mentor,” Mr. Papandreou said, concluding that Gen Z will be the “last generation to not grow up with AI.”
Will the average Gen Aer be more or less lonely than the average Gen Zer? One need not be Nostradamus to make a logical prediction. As the Fortune piece correctly noted, Gen A’s AI usage “will likely bring forward a whole new set of unforeseen mental health problems.” In other words, we haven’t seen anything yet.
