As the education sector grapples with the impacts of ChatGPT—an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbox—one university in Australia’s Group of Eight has introduced a new detection tool that can help teachers identify any unauthorised use of AI in student submissions.
The university noted that the unauthorised use of AI in assignments is “a form of cheating and is considered to be student misconduct.”
While the new tool—developed by a commercial provider—would not be entirely accurate, it will be used as one piece of information to indicate unauthorised use of AI in assignments and trigger further investigation.
“When unauthorised use of AI in assessments is determined, penalties may include a fail and mark of zero for the course, through to suspension or permanent exclusion,” the notice said.
“While the technology changes, our values around academic integrity do not. Your work must be your own and where the use of AI tools like ChatGPT have been permitted by your course convener, they must be properly credited, and your submissions must be substantially your own work.”
UNSW Deputy Vice-Chancellor Merlin Crossley described the new tool as an “anti-cheating software,” saying that educators don’t know how well the new software detects cheating, but “the students don’t know how well it works either.”
He noted that while the software will eventually be bypassed and people will find ways around it, “the next iteration will come out.”
“I believe that human lives will continue to unfold in two arenas – periods where ChatGPT is available and periods where it is not. We must train our students for both eventualities. It is not a question of embracing it or not. It is a question of how to train students for moments when it is not available.”
“We need medics who can assist a patient on a bushwalk or after a cyclone. We need leaders who can think on their feet, make decisions, and answer questions. We need teachers who can pass on their knowledge and skills.”
“So, in every course, we now must make sure we have assessments where students can use ChatGPT and some in which they cannot. Because in their lives students will face situations where they can use artificial intelligence and situations where they cannot.”
The university told students that it’s important to remember that the answers ChatGPT provide “reflects biases, opinions and views of the humans that informed the text it has been trained on, which may not align with your own values.”
But Steve Watson, co-convener of the Faculty of Education’s Knowledge, Power and Politics at the University of Cambridge said AI is a “double-edged sword” that people can’t just treat as “heralding the arrival of a new utopia.”
