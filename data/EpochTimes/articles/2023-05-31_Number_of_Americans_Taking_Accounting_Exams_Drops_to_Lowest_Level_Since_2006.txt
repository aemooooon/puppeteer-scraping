The number of Americans taking exams to enter the accounting profession has plunged to the lowest level in 17 years, according to new data from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
In 2022, the number of new entrants sitting Certified Public Accountants (CPA) exams dropped to just over 67,000, down from 72,000 in 2021, according to data published in AICPA’s annual report, marking a significant shortfall from the institute’s forecast of 74,000.
AICPA noted it had seen a declining number of U.S. accounting graduates and candidates sitting the exam, with the latest figures prominently being bolstered by candidates from overseas, which could further worsen the current shortage of professionals in the field across the United States.
To increase the number of Americans taking CPA exams and help ease shortages, AICPA said it had issued a “Draft Pipeline Acceleration Plan” focusing on “the root causes of awareness and attractiveness, costs, ease, and flexibility” that it said young Americans have cited as barriers to entry into the accounting profession.
The data comes as accounting courses are fast losing popularity among American graduates due, in part, to lower starting salaries when compared to other professions.
The accounting shortages are also being driven in part by a wave of retiring baby boomers, according to AICPA, which noted that 11,500 members retired in 2022.
However, experts now fear that the lack of accounting professionals is quickly becoming a crisis that will impact not just accounting firms, but also companies.
“With the length of time it takes to become a partner, the length of time it takes to achieve financial success, the financial model of CPA firms is archaic,” Alan Whitman, who previously ran the accounting firm Baker Tilly, told Financial Times.
