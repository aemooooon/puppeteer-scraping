Esper started his trip on Oct. 19 and visited Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.
He cautioned against “new threats on the horizon that we ignore at our own peril.”
These threats have emerged alongside technological advancements. Artificial intelligence, hypersonic weapons, and directed-energy weapons are all used in modern warfare and have “increased the lethality of modern weapon system[s].”
Esper said that the National Defense Strategy of the United States prioritizes China as the first threat and Russia as the second. This due to these two countries policies “to reshape the world to their favor at the expense of others through predatory economics, political subversion, and military force.”
Esper said he would convey a message to NATO allies that “every member must contribute its fair share to ensure our mutual security and uphold the international rules-based order.”
He said that currently, only eight members spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense as per the agreement reached by all NATO members in 2014. Half of the members took actions to achieve this goal but a number of members are “falling short,” according to Esper.
Esper also advised NATO allies: “If Huawei becomes a provider of choice … it is going to seriously undermine our ability to share intelligence, our ability to interoperate militarily, because we simply cannot trust those networks.”
In response to a question about Turkey’s recent incursion into Syria, Esper said, “Turkey put us all in a very terrible situation.
“I think the incursion was unwarranted. I think President Erdogan was fixated on making this incursion for one reason or another, and that was not a possibility that we were going to start a war with a NATO ally … who has been a very good ally since joining the Alliance in 1952.
“On any number of issues, we see them [Turkey] spinning closer into Russia’s orbit than in the Western orbit.
