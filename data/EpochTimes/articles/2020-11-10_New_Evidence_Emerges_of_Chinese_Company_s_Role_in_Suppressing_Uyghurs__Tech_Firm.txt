Following the U.S. commerce department’s decision to blacklist Chinese surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. due to their role in human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, an information company in the United States discovered new evidence that the company participated in Chinese authorities’ persecution of ethnic minorities.
It further analyzed that this means Dahua’s video surveillance software has a facial recognition function specifically designed to detect the facial features of Uyghur people, whose Eurasian features are distinctive from the Han majority Chinese. About 11 million Uyghurs, most of whom practice Islam, live in the Xinjiang area.
IPVM later contacted Dahua Technology, which declined to comment on this matter. The IPVM report stated that the relevant information on Dahua’s website was deleted about 30 minutes after IPVM contacted the firm.
