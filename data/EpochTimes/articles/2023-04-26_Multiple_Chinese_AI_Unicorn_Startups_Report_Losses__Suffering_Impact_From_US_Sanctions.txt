The loss was caused by U.S. sanctions in 2019 and 2022, which affected the company’s operations, from its supply chain to getting contracts, according to the company’s report.
All four companies are on the U.S. trade blacklist.
SenseTime and CloudWalk recently released their reports, showing losses for 2022.
According to various Chinese media reports, SenseTime’s core business in the “smart city” was down 50 percent year-on-year, mainly due to the impact of the pandemic.
SenseTime developed technology in facial recognition and its application in video analysis, autonomous driving, and remote sensing.
The company has been on the U.S. trade entity list for allegedly using its technology to assist the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) surveillance of Uyghurs.
The company said the significant loss was due to increased R&D expenses, asset impairment losses, and credit impairment losses.
