With Xi Jinping at the helm, it is unlikely China will recover economically or overtake the United States for several decades, if ever.
Xi’s complete lock on power means the country will be steered toward his future vision: greater security and forcible unification with Taiwan. Improved economic growth is not as high of a priority despite Xi’s call for China to become an upper-middle-income country by 2030.
In previous decades, China grew by moving people from the countryside to the city, where the GDP contribution of a factory worker is up to four times that of a farmer. Moving hundreds of millions of people dramatically increased the size of China’s GDP. Now, the country is largely urbanized, so there are no more tremendous gains to be had there.
In the past, China also used infrastructure construction to boost the economy. The GDP increased significantly when the first high-speed railways and improved roadways were built between cities. Most of the country is now connected through highways and high-speed trains except for small, obscure, and undeveloped villages. While connecting these villages may increase the villages’ GDP, it would have little or no impact on the national GDP. In fact, the cost of building such a connection could easily outweigh the benefit.
