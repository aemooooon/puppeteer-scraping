The British government had originally hoped that Arm would return to the LSE, but instead opted for New York, in what was seen as a major blow to the United Kingdom’s vision to become one of the world’s leading tech hubs.
Only 9.4 percent of Arm’s shares will be freely traded on Wall Street, while its Japanese parent is expected to own roughly 90.6 percent of the company’s outstanding shares after the completion of the IPO.
Meanwhile, some have called for more shares to be opened up to public investors.
Investors are hoping that the new listing will give a boost to an IPO market that has been sluggish since last year after electric vehicle maker Rivian’s massive launch in late 2021.
Arm’s launch is expected to fuel other tech startups planning to go public, as a success would signal new interest in the sector.
According to company estimates, Arm approximately controls 48.9 percent the market for semiconductor designs.
The firm’s processors and software platforms are integrated into more than 250 billion chips worldwide, ranging from sensors and smartphones to supercomputers.
Arm earns most of its revenues through royalty fees based on the average selling price of its chip designs acquired by its customers, or via a fixed fee per chip.
The firm’s sales fell to $2.68 billion due to a slump in global smartphone shipments for the year ended March 31.
The chipmaker anticipated huge potential revenue opportunity for its technology, which had a total addressable market (TAM) of $202.5 billion in 2022, according to its IPO filing.
