A five-year productivity inquiry into Australia’s digital technologies and data has found that the country could fall behind in the race against technological change.
The report said while Australia was doing well in terms of internet connections and data volumes, it was falling behind other countries on other advanced indicators.
“Australia’s internet speeds are relatively low, and business use of data-driven technologies, such as AI (artificial intelligence) and analytics, trails uptake in other countries,” the commission found.
Among agriculture businesses, unsuitable internet speed and geographic location were the most commonly cited factors limiting further technology adoption.
In light of the issue, the report said more digital infrastructure, especially in regional and remote Australia, was needed to improve access to low-cost and reliable internet for local businesses and workers.
At present, over 60 percent of Australian businesses in knowledge services and information media and telecommunications have adopted cloud technology, which is expected to bring forth the next wave of change.
At the same time, it was revealed that industries with higher uptake of cloud technology were also faster in embracing artificial intelligence.
Separately, manufacturing and supply chain logistics businesses had higher adoption of radio frequency identification and electronic data interchange tools.
However, the report noted that many enterprises might not invest enough in cyber security as they underestimated the likelihood or costs of online threats.
