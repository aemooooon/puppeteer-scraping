An investigation into the possession and distribution of child pornography covering eight southeastern U.S. states culminated in the arrest of 82 people and the rescue of 17 child victims, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI).
The four-month-long investigation, dubbed “Operation Southern Impact III,” resulted in three days of investigative actions including “search warrant executions, undercover operations, arrests, and sex offender compliance verification visits.” In total, 171 law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies were involved.
The ages of those arrested range from 20 to 70, the GBI said May 3. Occupations of arrestees included a “non-profit employee, small business owner, store clerk, mechanic, daycare administrator, youth group leader, former high school band director, freelance photographer, construction worker, and painter.”
As part of the operation, 861 digital devices were previewed and 1,613 digital devices were seized. Included among those devices were 203 mobile phones. The investigation stemmed from cyber tips received from the ICAC Task Force of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
In Georgia alone, 31 people were arrested, mostly for the possession or distribution of child pornography. Investigators said they targeted those distributing “the most violent sexual abuse material involving infants and toddlers” which the bureau itself noted, “is not uncommon.”
“The Georgia ICAC Task Force consistently finds this type of content,” the release stated.
Of those arrested in Georgia, seven traveled for the goal of meeting and having sex with a minor. Investigators say predators often visit chat rooms and sites on the internet to arrange such meetings. The arrested perpetrators targeted both boys and girls.
Four of those arrested in Georgia were registered sex offenders. One offender previously had been arrested during a similar operation in 2015.
“The dedicated law enforcement professionals that are part of the Georgia ICAC Task Force will not cease searching for those who are producing, trading and collecting this graphic material,” Debbie Garner, special agent in charge of the GBI’s Child Exploitation and Computer Crimes Unit said. “We will continue to work together to find, investigate and prosecute these predators.”
