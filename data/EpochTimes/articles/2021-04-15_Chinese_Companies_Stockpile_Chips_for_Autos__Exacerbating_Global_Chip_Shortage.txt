A global shortage of automotive chips has become critical this year, with almost all major automakers experiencing varying degrees of production cutbacks or short-term shutdowns resulting from a shortage caused by Chinese companies stockpiling chips.
Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the world’s largest producer of chips, has activated its “super hot runs’' queueing mode of production and has cut the production process in half, many orders are still delayed by 6 to 9 months for delivery.
Since this year, the shortage of automotive chips has led to an increasingly prominent phenomenon of car production. Volkswagen has not only cut production in China but also experienced major disruptions in global car production; Ford has cut production in the United States; Nissan, Honda, and Daimler have also experienced short-lived production shutdowns.
According to the sanctions the U.S. administration put on Huawei and SMIC, U.S. companies require licenses to export such products to SMIC. This has led Chinese companies to buy from Taiwan through distributors, in addition to stocking up before September last year.
Micro Control Unit (MCU) is a key automotive chip, with an average of more than 70 MCU chips used in each vehicle, accounting for 30 percent of all semiconductor components used in a car, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) that accounts for 70 percent of the world’s MCU production. This shows the importance of TSMC to the global automotive industry.
