That tends to indicate that the Fed might slow its pace or percentage rate of its ongoing interest-rate increases. Fourth-quarter 2022 GDP printed at 2.9 percent; it’s a key indicator of the Fed’s future actions. But it seems clear from the Fed’s own projections interest rates for most of 2023 will be 50 basis points—0.50 percent—or less going forward and, perhaps, even pause in an attempt to achieve a “soft landing”—that is, avoid a recession and substantially higher unemployment—leading into the 2024 election year.
But such a soft landing will be incredibly difficult, given a long-standing inverted yield curve, where investors can earn higher earnings from funds in shorter-term investments than longer-term bonds. An inverted yield curve tends to indicate investors are pulling their money from riskier investments (like new businesses) in favor of safe, risk-free, investments. Add to this already volatile mix the dispute over the debt ceiling and it spells a rocky few months—and maybe quarters—for the U.S. economy.
We think the odds of recession in 2023 are about 70 percent, led by the manufacturing sector, most likely starting in the third quarter.
