Beijing has indeed concealed its dispositions; to many Americans, China exemplifies a free market, not the oppression at home and expansionism abroad that is the reality. Undoubtedly this is why we are not combating communist China with the seriousness we employed against the Soviet Union.
Where are the Republicans?
President Joe Biden may absurdly (and unfairly) come out looking more hawkish on China than Mr. Scott.
In the House of Representatives, meanwhile, Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, the North Carolina Republican, prefers the expansion of cabinet departments’ corporate blacklists without any new requirements for disclosure of deals with Chinese entities. Mr. McHenry recently disparaged Mr. Cornyn’s tack as “a terrible idea” that “will be cumbersome for capital allocation internationally, it will be a massive expansion of state powers, and it won’t work.”
But Mr. Toomey, a fierce free trader, also asked, “Why would you start a firm in the U.S. if you know doing so risks precluding you from investing in China—the second largest economy in the world?”
Countering this perception is House Select Committee on China Chairman Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican, who seeks “a sector-specific approach” fully banning the sale of various advanced technologies to China, “the obvious areas where we shouldn’t be subsidizing our own destruction.” Then beyond that, bans on university endowments and state and local governments’ investments in China.
