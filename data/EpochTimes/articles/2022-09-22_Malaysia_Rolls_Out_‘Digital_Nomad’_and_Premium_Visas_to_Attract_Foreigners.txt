Malaysia has rolled out a new visa scheme that allows foreigners to travel and work remotely in the country, as the Southeast Asian nation strives to become the preferred digital-nomad hub in the region.
The “DE Rantau” nomad visa, which will be launched on Oct. 1, aims to promote “digital professional mobility” within the country and boost tourism, according to the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).
The visa primarily targets workers in the technology industry—such as those with expertise in software development, cybersecurity, blockchain, and artificial intelligence—but it is also open to workers in other fields.
Home Minister Hamzah Zainuddin said the visa will be available to foreigners from all nations starting on Oct. 1, except for individuals from countries that do not have diplomatic ties with Malaysia.
“We are also confident that the program can draw more foreign direct investment that can strengthen the economy and create jobs for Malaysians. Demand for the ringgit will also increase and its value will strengthen,” he said, referring to the official currency of Malaysia.
But applicants must have at least 1 million ringgits ($220,000) in their bank account, and only up to 50 percent of the principal value can be withdrawn for the purchase of property or medical and educational expenses.
