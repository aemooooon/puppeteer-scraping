The Chinese regime is the “greatest adversary” of the United States, having the capability to unseat it as a global hegemon, according to former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe.
He described Beijing as both an adversary and competitor to the United States, noting that “they should be more of a competitor and less of an adversary, and it’s the other way around right now.”
He wrote the piece in the hopes of clearing up the question of which country poses the No. 1 threat to the United States. As DNI, Ratcliffe was able to look at all the intelligence collected across U.S. agencies, and “it was so clear that China, and China alone, presented the greatest national security threat,” Ratcliffe said at the event. “That wasn’t something that I had seen as a member of Congress,” he said, referring to his time as a representative for Texas immediately before taking the position of DNI.
“What worries me most about China now is that they’ve got a lot of momentum,” he said. “They didn’t just become our No. 1 adversary overnight.”
Beijing’s aggressive efforts to advance cutting-edge technology are of particular concern to Ratcliffe.
“China’s investment in things like artificial intelligence and machine learning and biometrics ... are a way that they know they can close the gap with the United States even faster,” he said.
The U.S. administration should continue to recognize the regime as the top threat, so the United States can “counter them in a productive way that we really should have been for the last few years, not just starting now.”
Officials when discussing the issue should set aside political narratives and be “honest about the intelligence,” he said.
