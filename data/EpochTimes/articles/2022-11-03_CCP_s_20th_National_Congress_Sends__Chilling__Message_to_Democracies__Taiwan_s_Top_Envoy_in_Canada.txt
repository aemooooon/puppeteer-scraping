Taiwan’s top envoy in Canada says the recent national congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sends a “chilling” message to like-minded democracies around the world.
“The political report delivered by Mr. Xi Jinping on Oct. 16 has sent a chilling message to all of us in the like-minded group [of democracies],” said Tseng, previously deputy minister of Taiwan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry.
“I think it indicates that China as a market is getting more uncertain [and] is getting riskier for Canada and for other countries because we will be trading with someone that lays stress not on profit, but on political control,” he added.
Xi’s speech emphasized that the communist regime will “strengthen the safeguards for ensuring economic, major infrastructure, financial, cyber, data, biological, resource, nuclear, space, and maritime security.”
“Mechanisms for countering foreign sanctions, interference, and long-arm jurisdiction will be strengthened,” Xi stressed, adding that the regime will “oppose Taiwan independence,” and “will take resolute action to prevent and stop interference in the affairs of Hong Kong and Macao by external forces.”
“Their reaffirmed zero-COVID policy remains a major risk for growth. There is no hope of loosening regulations on internet platforms, and its real estate industry sees no policy U-turn,” Tseng said.
Closing remarks from a CCP spokesperson at the congress stressed a message of “equality over prosperity,“ he added, which Tseng said, ”spells a return to a communism not unlike the era under Mao.”
“We understand that FIPA and CPTPP are very complicated issues,” Tseng said, while noting that the two countries have had three discussions since January on “very good faith.”
“I understand that trade matters need to go through different sectoral concerns and that you want to make sure you are not signing some agreement at the expense of your business community—we understand that.”
