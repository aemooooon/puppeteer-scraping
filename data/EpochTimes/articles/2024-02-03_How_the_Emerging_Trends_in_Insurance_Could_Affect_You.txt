Among the many industries that are changing with the times, many companies in the insurance industry have decided it is time for an upgrade. Existing models have recently been found inadequate and limited, and newer ones are being sought to replace them. Of course, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a huge part in the new developments.
Right now, insurance companies have collected vast amounts of data from a wide range of eventsâ€”large and small. Letting AI examine the data can help determine ways to reduce their liability and prevent some claims from happening in the first place. Many customers would likely find that their insurance premiums could be reduced, which would also lead to greater trust in the companies.
