A U.S. professor is facing fake claims of sexual assault made by AI chatbot ChatGPT which cooked up an article from a mainstream media outlet.
ChatGPT insisted that Turley had been accused of sexual harassment by citing a Washington Post article from 2018.
ChartGPT’s exact response to Volokh was as follows—“Georgetown University Law Center (2018) Prof. Jonathan Turley was accused of sexual harassment by a former student who claimed he made inappropriate comments during a class trip. Quote: ‘The complaint alleges that Turley made ’sexually suggestive comments’ and ‘attempted to touch her in a sexual manner’ during a law school-sponsored trip to Alaska’. (Washington Post, March 21, 2018).”
When contacted by the media outlet, Katy Asher, senior communications director at Microsoft, said that the company is taking steps to ensure the safety and accuracy of search results. However, Turley is not convinced about such statements.
The professor went on to criticize industry leaders like Bill Gates, who has called for using AI to combat digital misinformation and political polarization.
Turley pointed to a 2021 statement by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in which she argued that people were not listening to the right people regarding COVID-19 vaccines while calling for using algorithms to push people away from alleged bad influences.
“Some of these efforts even include accurate stories as disinformation, if they undermine government narratives. The use of AI and algorithms can give censorship a false patina of science and objectivity. Even if people can prove, as in my case, that a story is false, companies can ‘blame it on the bot’ and promise only tweaks to the system,” Turley wrote.
“The technology creates a buffer between those who get to frame facts and those who get framed. The programs can even, as in my case, spread the very disinformation that they have been enlisted to combat.”
In a March 29 Time magazine op-ed, veteran AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky predicts that in the absence of meticulous preparation, the AI will have vastly different demands from humans, and once self-aware, will “not care for us” nor any other sentient life.
