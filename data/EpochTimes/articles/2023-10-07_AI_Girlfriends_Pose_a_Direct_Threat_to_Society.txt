In truth, though, they pose a threat to society in general. After all, these young men are our brothers, cousins, neighbors, college roommates, and work colleagues. Their decisions have ripple effects that go way beyond the individual level.
Due to increasing demand, sites offering customizable AI girlfriends are becoming more sophisticated in nature. Take DreamGF, for example, a site that allows users to create their ideal partner. From piercings to tattoos, ethnicity to personality type, every single aspect can be tailored to an individual’s needs.
Want a 23-year-old partner who never wrinkles or complains? In just a couple of clicks, DreamGF can make this dream come true. Of course, this is less of a dream and more of a nightmare. AI girlfriends aren’t real. They’re pixelated creatures—monstrosities, even—operating on nothing more than powerful algorithms. Sadly, though, in the brains of lonely individuals, this fact doesn’t register. Or if it does, it doesn’t appear to matter.
One can’t discuss the rise in AI girlfriends without discussing the rise in loneliness—particularly among young men.
Remember, “Game of Thrones” is a TV series, albeit a thoroughly gripping one. TV shows and the characters that they offer can’t compete with the power of carefully curated AI creations. When Tyrion Lannister speaks into the camera, he isn’t really speaking to one viewer in particular. With an AI girlfriend, however, this isn’t the case. “She” is speaking to the user. “She” knows his fears, hopes, and dreams, and because of this knowledge, “she” can manipulate him, psychologically and emotionally. It’s very easy to imagine a whole generation of young men, many of whom have never been on an actual date, falling for an AI girlfriend and never looking back.
AI is about to pour unimaginable amounts of gasoline on a tech-fueled fire.
