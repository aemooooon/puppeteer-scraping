The year 2027 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CCP and the PLA (People’s Liberation Army). Xi’s goal can be seen as a dangerous sign that he intends to use all armed might to indulge in aggressive wars.
In comparison, the 2020 estimate from SIPRI pegs the CCP’s nominal defense spending at $252.3 billion—almost 1.4 times higher than the official figure.
Lindsay Maizland, author of the CFR report, noted that the CCP’s traditional military services of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have been significantly upgraded both in terms of the number of weaponry and in high-tech use since 2015—when Xi was “pushing to transform the PLA from a largely territorial force into a major maritime power.”
For example, the CCP’s military has elevated its rocket force, responsible for maintaining its conventional and nuclear missiles, to become an independent service.
Intelligent technologies involve the substantial use of unmanned equipment and technology, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI).
Wu emphasized in the article his belief that “the United States has developed or used a large number of Small Diameter Bombs, smart missiles, drones, and robotic soldiers” as a strategic measure to target China and Russia.
Actually, the CCP’s accomplishments in military modernization of weaponry, significant progress in information technologies, as well as the use of artificial intelligence technologies demonstrates that this is the field that likely has a strategy for targeting the United States.
Brown revealed areas in which the CCP is ahead, such as “facial recognition software, small drones, quantum communications, telecommunications, genetic data, cryptocurrency, and more.”
