In an effort to combat the threat from the Chinese regime, the U.S. National Intelligence and Security Center (NCSC) has prioritized the following five key sectors: artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, semiconductors, and autonomous systems.
The question worth asking, though, is this: Has the NCSC report come five years too late? In all five sectors, as I demonstrate below, China is already ahead.
Let’s start with AI: As the report notes, China already possesses “the might, talent, and ambition” to win the AI arms race.
The researchers warned that, by the end of the decade, “Chinese threat groups will likely collect data that enables quantum simulators to discover new economically valuable materials, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.”
As the Booz Allen researchers noted, “most of quantum computing’s potential lies more than a decade in the future—but risk management must start now.”
The final sector involves autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and surveillance drones.
For any Americans reading this piece, I’m sure it’s difficult to find any positives. All, though, is not lost. China may very well be the geopolitical equivalent of a lone wolf, prowling the geopolitical prairielands, picking off weaker prey. However, the United States is very different. Its leaders recognize that there is strength in numbers.
The wars of tomorrow will be won by the people with the sharpest minds and the best intel. On its own, America would struggle to contain a rapidly rising China; with its Australian and British allies, however, America now has a significant advantage.
President Joe Biden, to his credit, has also worked to bolster the cyber and AI capabilities of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (more commonly referred to as the Quad), which is a strategic dialogue between the United States, India, Japan, and Australia. Last September, the foursome announced the creation of the Quad Senior Cyber Group.
