Dr. Robert Epstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, told The Epoch Times that Google has access to a number of powerful manipulation methods mostly through “ephemeral experiences” that can shift votes.
In a more recent study, Epstein analyzed Google’s “Go Vote” reminder on Election Day 2018 and found it gave the Democratic party between 800,000 and 4.6 million more votes than it gave Republicans. He used the same calculations Google’s data analysts performed before they added the prompt. Epstein characterized it as “vote manipulation,” not a public service.
Epstein, who considers himself a moderate who leans liberal, said his chief concern was Google’s power to not only suppress content but also determine the order it appears in—also known as filtering and ordering.
Conservatives have long decried what they described as unfair treatment from major technology companies. “Shadowbanning”—the surreptitious suppression of a user’s content by social media platforms, is also often pointed to.
Google’s manipulation tactics, Epstein said, are legal and save the company money when compared to using other methods of influence, such as donations.
