An election lawsuit brought by Arizona state Sen. Sonny Borrelli that challenged Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs’ win was dismissed because, according to the judge, he waited too long to serve the defendants.
In part, Borrelli’s lawyers claimed that Maricopa used artificial intelligence software to make scans and then gave a verification ranking to signatures in Maricopa County.
“The use of nongovernmental, third-party artificial intelligence software as a substitute for the statutorily mandated signature-verification process violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection provisions because there is no formalized statewide procedure or standard for electoral staff to evaluate whether a ‘confidence level’ has been met, that is whether the Delegated Software has accurately assessed whether two signatures are a match,” the suit contended.
Because of how the signatures are ranked by the software, it “leads to arbitrary results where there is a greater likelihood in some places that one’s vote will not be counted the same as the vote of someone else who cast an early ballot,” the lawsuit added.
Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer refuted that claim, saying the country doesn’t use artificial intelligence in that manner.
The judge said that the case would involve soliciting expert testimony about artificial intelligence, which would delay the challenge even further. The swearing-in ceremony for Arizona’s next governor is Jan. 5, 2023.
Borrelli’s team, meanwhile, wrote that the signature verification process swayed the result of the gubernatorial race. GOP challenger Kari Lake, a former local Fox station reporter backed by former President Donald Trump, trails Hobbs by about 17,000 votes.
