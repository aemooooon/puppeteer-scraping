Hunting for a job is nerve-wracking and challenging. Many parts go to presenting yourself to a prospective employer. The first step to opening the door is a solid resume. A resume shows off your relevant experience and tells the recruiter you’re the one for the job.
In the United States, evaluating an employee when personal information is provided has Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) implications.
If you’re applying for a local job, your address could eliminate you if you live across town from the office. You may not think that’s a big deal, but the employer may think you'll be late driving that distance.
This is just taking up valuable real estate on your resume, and, frankly, nobody cares.
Recruiters often use software that scans resumes for keywords. They’re looking for similarities between your qualifications and the job description. Not having graphics improves your chances of the software catching all your keywords.
Many hiring managers will look at someone with qualifications that are close to what is needed for the position. You don’t have to embellish to be in the running.
You don’t want to list any obsolete skills you have. For example, if you’re good at MS-DOS or Vista, don’t put that on your resume; it’s considered obsolete and won’t help you. Instead, highlight what you know about the latest technology.
