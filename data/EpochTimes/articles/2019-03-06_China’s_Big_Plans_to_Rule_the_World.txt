The recent near-shutdown of Chinese tech giant ZTE due to violating U.S. sanctions with Iran is a prime example. ZTE’s reliance on U.S.-made microchips allowed the United States to shut the company down with just one decision by the Trump administration. The decision to withhold supplies of necessary microchips as well as a stiff fine of $1 billion has sent a message to ZTE and its Chinese masters that the United States is taking a much stricter view of China’s illegal behavior.
This, of course, has made Chinese leaders keenly aware of their vulnerabilities, as if they weren’t already. With the stroke of a pen, the United States was able to effectively shut down one of their largest tech companies by withholding U.S.-made parts and nearly eliminating 75,000 jobs.
The Chinese not only seek to replace foreign technology and especially data and network infrastructure with Chinese made and owned technology, but their plan is also to put foreign competitors out of business completely. In other words, they want to have the power to disrupt and heavily influence the economies of those nations that today have power over China. For China, trade is viewed as a zero-sum game that involves destroying competitors.
Given their past behavior, going all the way back to their broken promise to open their market to the West in 2000, it’s likely that China’s promise to delay or scale back their ambitions will be mostly minor adjustments around the edges. That means the world must act to reign in China. The free nations of the world must each decide what kind of future they want.
