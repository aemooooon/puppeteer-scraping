U.S. economic productivity gains translate to decreased quality of life for most Americans.
However, the increase in productivity hasn’t been beneficial for the average American. It was driven by reduced costs as a result of telework, increased workloads, and automation, none of which translates to an improvement in employees’ standard of living or an increase in job opportunities.
Significant savings occurred as 10-year office leases expired and were either not renewed or downsized to smaller workspaces. Additionally, with the decline in the need for client meetings, even the reduced office space no longer required a downtown location or even a location within the city. Simultaneously, while companies saw cost reductions, revenues remained stable or increased. Achieving the same or higher revenue with reduced costs inherently signifies an improvement in both efficiency and productivity.
The implication of a productivity increase, as touted by the White House, is that with increased productivity, the economy is doing better. More people can find jobs, and jobs will pay higher wages. But if the increase in productivity comes from an increase in workload, this really means that each worker is now doing more than one job, and fewer jobs are available for job seekers. For example, 10 employees are now doing 10 percent more work each than before the pandemic; they collectively eliminated one job. This is a win for the company whose profits will increase, adding to one of the indicators of a good economy: increased corporate profits.
