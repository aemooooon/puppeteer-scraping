After Chinese tech giant Huawei recently pulled out of the U.S. solar market and set its sights on Israel instead, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette warned Israel about the security risks involved with Chinese solar products.
He added that while the solar industry might appear “innocent,” certain countries, such as China, “would use infrastructure developments to develop intelligence sources or data sets that can be used against [host countries].”
He warned, “China is a particular concern for us [and] has been for some time, but what I have seen so far in Israel and in other countries is that people are recognizing the threat and they are reacting to it.”
A solar inverter converts DC (direct current) currents generated by solar panels when they capture sunlight into AC (alternating current) currents, which are then fed into electrical grids. Then, the electricity generated is funneled into household electrical sockets that power one’s everyday appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.
Huawei’s solar inverters have WiFi capability.
“Many [Chinese] companies are directly connected to their government, and a lot of the information, such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, is data that is easily collected from these infrastructure projects,” Brouillette said.
He summed up by saying, “In many cases, countries are not aware that China is collecting that data or positioning themselves to literally control the infrastructure in their country.”
“The United States has an interest in the future forward presence of United States naval vessels at the Port of Haifa in Israel, but has serious security concerns with respect to the leasing arrangements of the Port of Haifa,” the bill states.
The U.S. government should “urge the Government of Israel to consider the security implications of foreign investment in Israel,” it states.
China isn’t named directly in the bill.
