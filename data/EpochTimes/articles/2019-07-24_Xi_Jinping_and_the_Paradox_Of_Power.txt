At the moment, Xi Jinping’s rule over China is as absolute as any ruler’s since perhaps Stalin wielded his iron grip over Russia and the Soviet Union. That’s no accident. Xi’s ascent to power has been marked by his enemies underestimating him, his cunning political skills, a readiness to bend or break the rules and a fearless brutality against whomever might stand in his way.
The system has instilled fear and terror in the populace, as those with a low “credit score” suddenly become social pariahs or even simply disappear from life. Stephen Mosher of the New York Post describes Xi’s China in chilling terms:
“China’s already formidable police state has been upgraded using big data, machine learning, face recognition technology and artificial intelligence into a fearsome cyborg of state control. The Chinese Communist Party has given birth to the world’s first high-tech digital dictatorship.”
Xi’s ability to control his 1.4 billion subjects, identify potential trouble makers, arrest them, punish them and put them away if necessary is as efficient as possible. But abroad, his arrogant pronouncements and celebration of China’s rise at the expense of other nations’ jobs and technology base, particularly in the West, has led to a reversal in how China is regarded. He’s turned it into the dragon of the world, rather than the panda.
But politically, he cannot afford to admit this reality. The memory of Gorbachev’s Glasnost and the collapse of the Soviet Union hangs over Xi like a specter. He fears that any moderation or openness would not only shatter his political image, but also result in losing his grip on power and the demise of the CCP. And he’s right.
