The working paradigm in America seems to be shifting as unemployment and staff shortages exist alongside workers refusing to work and others obtaining their dream job through the gig economy.
The most likely reason for the shortage of workers is a shift in mindset. The lockdowns caused a lot of people to rethink their lives and priorities. After the unemployment and stimulus checks stopped coming, many discovered that they were unwilling to return to low-end jobs that they hated. Some of these people sought new opportunities, such as freelancing, while others are opposed to working.
A much larger number of people have taken to the gig economy to do work on a for-hire basis. Many use freelancing as a way to do jobs they are traditionally unqualified for. Artificial intelligence (AI) programs in companies’ hiring processes also push people to the gig economy. The traditional job-hunting process demotivates people because AI disqualifies them from their desired jobs. Most resumes are never seen by a hiring manager.
The barrier to entry is low for freelancing because people don’t need formal education or qualifications to access better-paying jobs. All they need are a few reviews and samples for employers to decide whether to hire them or not. Freelancing websites such as Fiverr or Upwork have made it even easier because anyone can get started on them in minutes.
Consequently, this new trend in employment is, in many ways, a return to a free-market labor economy. The buyer (employer) and the seller (freelancer) are free to enter or leave the market. And only freelancers who do good work or persevere end up succeeding. Adam Smith, the founding father of economics, would nod approvingly.
