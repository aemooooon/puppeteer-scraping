Microsoft and artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI are being sued by nonfiction authors who allege the tech companies trained the ChatGPT tool to copy their work without consent.
Microsoft and OpenAI announced a partnership earlier this year, following several years of investment in the AI company by Microsoft.
“In doing so, they have infringed on the exclusive rights of Plaintiff Sancton and other writers and rightsholders whose work has been copied and appropriated to train their artificial intelligence models,” the lawsuit states.
Mr. Sancton’s lawsuit also alleges OpenAI and Microsoft “built a business valued into the tens of billions of dollars by taking the combined works of humanity without permission.”
He claims to have “dedicated five years of his life and tens of thousands of dollars to completing the book,” traveling around the world to complete the necessary research. The court documents say the investment of time and money was feasible because, “in exchange for their creative efforts, the Copyright Act grants” authors exclusive rights in their works.
“This case is about Defendants OpenAI and Microsoft’s complete disregard for those exclusive rights,” the lawsuit reads.
“Defendants have made commercial reproductions of millions, maybe billions, of copyrighted works without any compensation to authors, without a license, and without permission.”
The court documents also call the basis of the OpenAI platform “nothing less than the rampant theft of copyrighted works.” It’s being alleged in the lawsuit that both Microsoft and OpenAI have achieved significant financial success commercializing the author’s work, making billions of dollars through revenue on AI products.
OpenAI has reportedly made over a billion dollars in revenue during 2023. It has also raised $14 billion across nine funding rounds. However, the company’s total value has been estimated to be upwards of at least $80 billion.
It’s unclear how much revenue the authors think came from the alleged infringement of their works. A jury trial is being requested, along with compensation for damages, expenses, and attorneys’ fees.
