The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf revealed that backdoors had been installed in all the TV sets made by Chinese manufacturer TCL, and that the department was reviewing the company’s activities. Wolf added that the DHS would soon issue a related business advisory to warn against using data services and equipment from firms that are linked to the Chinese regime.
TCL Electronics Holdings is an electronics and electrical appliance manufacturing company headquartered in Huizhou city, Guangdong Province, China. It produces mobile phones, computers, household appliances, electrical lighting, and flat-panel TVs and sells them both in and outside of China.
TCL is the world’s third-largest television manufacturer by market share.
Wolf pointed out the company’s close ties with the Chinese regime in his remarks. “TCL also receives CCP [Chinese Communist Party] state support to compete in the global electronics market,” he said.
Southwest Computer Co. is a scientific research and production base for developing electronic military equipment.
Li said in the 2004 article, “TCL will use its R&D platform and human resources at home and abroad to extensively learn advanced foreign electronic information technology, in order to promote the development of China’s military equipment.”
On Dec.16, 2004, an exchange event called the “military-civilian integration seminar” was held in Chongqing city. According to media reports, Li emphasized TCL’s technical advantages in the information technology industry: “national defense and military products mainly rely on national industries, and TCL, as a large Chinese enterprise, should bear the responsibility.”
