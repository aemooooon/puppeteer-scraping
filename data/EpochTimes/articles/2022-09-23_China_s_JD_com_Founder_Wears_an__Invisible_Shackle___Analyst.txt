Liu Qiangdong, or Richard Liu, founder and chairman of JD.com, recently transferred his ownership of equity shares at two subsidiary companies after stepping down as CEO in April.
Since the CCP tightened its antitrust regulation, Chinese e-commerce and tech companies—including Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com—have faced a series of disciplinary warnings and fines.
The warning came after Beijing released its new anti-monopoly guidelines in February 2021. The rules targeted the big internet platforms; for example, e-commerce giant Alibaba was fined $2.75 billion in April 2021.
Then Liu stepped down from his post as executive director in September 2021 and as CEO in April 2022. He remained the chairman of the board.
In recent years, China’s top business leaders—such as Alibaba’s Jack Ma, ByteDance’s Zhang Yiming, and Pinduoduo’s Chang Huangzheng—have taken early retirements.
Wang said, “The many Chinese Liu Qiangdongs are all wearing invisible shackles under the CCP’s ruling.”
Between 2019 and June 30, 2021, Liu resigned from at least 298 companies as president, chairman, and shareholder.
Wang said that Liu’s actions showed that he was trying to protect his interests, but he couldn’t stop the CCP. “Beyond the limit, the regime will hit him as hard as it dealt with Didi.”
Wang said CCP leader Xi Jinping is tightening his grip on power and reining in political rivals and business leaders ahead of the Party’s 20th National Congress. The dictatorship will never allow uncontrolled development of private enterprises such as the internet giants.
