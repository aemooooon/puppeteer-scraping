Elon Musk’s neurotechnology company Neuralink hosted a “show and tell” on Wednesday aimed at recruiting new talent.
In the description box of the video, Neuralink asked people to “join us in our mission to build generalized I/O devices for the brain” alongside a link to the company’s career page.
The job openings require no prior experience in neuroscience, according to Neuralink, as the company will “teach you everything you need to know.”
The company began testing the device out on animals in 2019.
During Wednesday’s event, the monkeys made an appearance again, this time in the form of “Sake” who used a virtual keyboard to telepathically type out the words “welcome to show and tell.”
“Here you can see Sake, that’s one of our other monkeys, typing on a keyboard. This is telepathic typing. Though to be clear, he’s not actually using a keyboard. He’s moving the cursor with his mind to the highlighted key. Now technically, he can’t actually spell. So I don’t wanna oversell this thing, because that’s the next version,” Musk said.
The businessman also stressed that Sake and other monkeys used by the company enjoy doing the tasks and are happy and that Neuralink “cares about animal welfare” amid concerns from animal rights groups.
