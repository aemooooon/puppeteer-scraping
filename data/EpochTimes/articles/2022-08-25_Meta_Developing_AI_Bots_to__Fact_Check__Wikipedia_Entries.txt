Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has developed the world’s first artificial intelligence (AI) model that’s capable of automatically verifying hundreds of thousands of citations at once, a feature the firm says could help make entries on Wikipedia “more accurate.”
The model ranks the cited source and also lists out potential alternative sources that might support the claim. A human editor can then review the AI-supplied citation for approval. According to Meta, the AI model will “bolster” the quality of knowledge in Wikipedia.
That the AI is being developed by Meta, which is widely known to censor conservative content, while promoting anti-conservative content on its platform, has raised eyebrows.
For instance, Facebook insisted on making a “newsworthy exception” when a CNN anchor labeled white men as terror threats. Similarly, the guidance said it was OK to attack white men who don’t support LGBT causes.
Last year, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger acknowledged that Wikipedia has slipped into “leftist propaganda,” moving away from its neutral stance. Sanger left Wikipedia 20 years ago because he wasn’t happy with the direction of the platform.
In April, it was found that editors at Wikipedia deleted an entry on President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s investment and advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners. The business, founded in 2009, came under congressional scrutiny due to the younger Biden’s overseas dealings.
