The CEO of Tesla and Twitter, Elon Musk, donated nearly $2 billion in Tesla shares to charity last year.
Musk’s SEC filing did not name the recipients of his donations, which were made between August and December 2022.
Musk had previously signed the Giving Pledge in 2012, which commits those who join the agreement to give at least half of their wealth to charity throughout their lifetime or upon their death.
In 2001, he set up the Musk Foundation, which offers grants for “development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity,” along with other causes, according to its website.
Meanwhile, Musk announced on Feb. 15 that he planned to find someone to succeed him as the CEO of Twitter by the end of the year.
“I think I need to stabilize the organization and just make sure it’s in a financially healthy place and that the product roadmap is clearly laid out,” he said. He has admitted in the past that Twitter was close to bankruptcy and that he planned to turn it around financially.
Musk acquired the social media platform last spring for $44 billion and has significantly restructured the company with mass layoffs, a revamped interface and members system, along with a relaxation of censorship rules.
He also exposed the previous management’s collusion with U.S. federal law enforcement and the Democrats’ attempts to go after former president Donald Trump.
However, Musk has taken criticism from many Tesla investors, who accuse him of spending too much of his time focusing on Twitter at the expense of his car company.
Back in November, while addressing the G20 Summit in Bali, Musk admitted that he was working too much while he manages his responsibilities as CEO of Twitter, Tesla, and SpaceX.
