Speaking of the tremendous potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize government services and improve efficiency, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced an AI Action Plan for “responsible” implementation of the technology by the city government.
“With the release of our AI Action Plan, the first-of-its-kind for a major U.S. city, we are cementing our commitment to this emerging technology’s responsible use, and ensuring we are deploying the right tools in the right ways,” Mr. Adams wrote.
Mr. Adams gave one example of how the implementation of artificial agents can support multiculturalism in New York City, describing how his administration have started utilizing robocalls featuring his voice in multiple languages.
AI can, in some circumstances, “exhibit patterns of bias and discrimination” due to a lack of extensive and diverse research, it said.
Expanding on the original MyCity phase, which launched in March to help New York City families apply for child care assistance, this extension now includes a range of valuable content designed to support business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs throughout their journey of starting, managing, and expanding businesses in the Empire State.
