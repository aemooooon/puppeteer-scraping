Joe Rogan has warned of the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI) after a version of his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” was created entirely through the use of AI technology, sparking concern among listeners.
“This is going to get very slippery, kids,” Rogan wrote on Twitter on April 11 in response to a video of the fake show shared on the social media platform by content creator Farzad Mesbahi.
A disclaimer on the video noted that the contents depict a “fictional” podcast between Rogan and Altman, with all content generated using AI language models.
“The ideas and opinions expressed in the podcast are not reflective of the thoughts of Joe Rogan or Sam Altman,” the disclaimer reads.
At one point, “Altman” even discusses his work with Elon Musk.
“I’m curious to know what it’s like to work with Elon Musk,” the fake Rogan asks Altman on the show. “He’s such a controversial and influential figure in the tech world and I’m sure it must be an interesting experience to work with him. Can you tell me a bit about your experience working with Elon and your thoughts on him as a person and a leader?”
“It’s definitely been an interesting experience working with Elon, he’s definitely a very intelligent and driven person and he has a lot of great ideas and insights, he’s definitely someone who is always thinking about the future and how to make the world a better place and I really respect that about him,” the fake Altman responds.
Rogan fans expressed their concerns over the AI-generated show, with many noting how realistic it is. Others shared their worries about the pace at which AI technology is progressing.
Content creator Mesbahi urged people to press government officials to address the issues posed by advanced AI, noting that the fake podcast is just one example of what the technology can do.
“Imagine in, one year, five years, 10 years,” he wrote.
