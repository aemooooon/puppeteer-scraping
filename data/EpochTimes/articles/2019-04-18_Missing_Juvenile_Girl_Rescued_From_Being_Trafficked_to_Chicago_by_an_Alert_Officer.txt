A regular traffic stop helped police to rescue a missing girl who was being trafficked to Chicago by an older man.
Ross found a young girl riding with an older male inside the Sentra. The girl and the man had no identification on them and didn’t speak English.
They were of El Salvadoran descent and a translator was called to the spot. The police found out that the girl was 15 years old and the man was 35 years old.
Police investigated from its databases that the girl was a missing juvenile from New Jersey. The man had forced her into sex acts and she was being taken to Chicago.
The police arrested the man and charged him with abduction. He’s currently at the Lucas County jail while the girl is at a hospital for medical care.
One key finding from the report—that’s prepared for use by law enforcement agencies across the United States—was that web traffic to advertising websites selling sex drew only 5 to 8 percent of the total unique visitors that Backpage drew at its height in 2016.
