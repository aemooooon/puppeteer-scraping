The system is going to be implemented across all of China in 2020, and local governments have already begun setting it in motion.
In the music video, a handful of young Chinese celebrities give a glowing show of how they abide by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) social control system, and play up how behaving with “integrity” and “trustworthiness,” according to the surveillance system’s requirements, raises their scores and benefits them.
Keep in mind that under the CCP, phrases such as “being trustworthy,” “having credibility,” and “acting with integrity” have very different meanings than they have in free countries. This specifically means being “trustworthy” in the eyes of the ruling communist regime, having “credibility” by never violating its totalitarian standards, and having “integrity” to always follow its will regardless of whether or not the regime can see your actions.
The video portrays an Orwellian reality, under a regime with all the horrors of labor camps and torture we saw under the Soviets, but with a polished, friendly facade.
Of course, this is the goal of propaganda. It doesn’t need to be true or false. It just needs to elicit an intended emotional response. People gradually become conditioned to associate the programmed emotion with the issue.
This differs from misinformation, which is the direct use of false information either to muddle an issue or spread confusion, and from disinformation, which uses more complex forms of deception, such as staged events and planted evidence, to create reports that appear true.
These all fall under the banner of psychological warfare (or “PsyOps”), which aims to alter the way an issue is interpreted. It works through the subversion of a person’s cycle of meaning, to alter the way they view issues as “symbols” of various concepts or feelings.
