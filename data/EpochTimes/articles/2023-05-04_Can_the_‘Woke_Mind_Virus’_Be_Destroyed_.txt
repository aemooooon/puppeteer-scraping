First of all, it’s important to get our definitions in order. What, exactly, is the woke mind virus? Musk told Maher that the virus can be defined by two key features: (a) the suppression of free speech and (b) the promotion of anti-meritocratic values.
For example, significantly more female than male faculty now favor protections against hate speech, “even if this restricts speech not intended to be hateful (19 percent of females, 8 percent of males), as well as restricting speech only where words are intended to be hateful (38 percent of females, 29 percent of males),” according to the FIRE report. Interestingly, significantly more male than female faculty support restricting speech “only where words are certain to incite violence (62 percent of males, 42 percent of females).”
This brings us to the second component of the virus: the fostering of anti-meritocratic values.
Moreover, meritocracy, he said, is an essential ingredient for “fostering innovation, creativity, and economic growth, as it rewards individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.”
All hope, however, is not lost.
