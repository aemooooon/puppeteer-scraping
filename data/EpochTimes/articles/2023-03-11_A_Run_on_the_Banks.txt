On Mar. 9, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) lost 60 percent of its value. It showed an aftertax loss of $1.8 billion. Silicon Valley is unique in that, since its inception, its primary target market has been the startup community in the Bay Area. As it expanded across the country, it targeted the startup market.
If you haven’t noticed, the startup market has taken a nosedive last year. Startup firms laid off thousands of people. Big Tech has also laid off thousands of people. The U.S. economy under President Joe Biden hasn’t been very good to it. Combine that with a rapid ramp up in the cost of borrowing by the Federal Reserve with no end in sight and the startup market is bleeding.
Banks saw a historical large percentage increase in deposits during COVID as the economy was shuttered and the U.S. government paid people not to work. Banks had no choice but to purchase U.S. Treasuries with that extra money. The problem was that when the economy reopened, inflation attacked with a vengeance due to all the government spending. The Biden administration increased the level of government spending in March 2021 by a trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve raised rates aggressively, and the banks were caught. That’s why this is not like 2008, although the root cause is similar. Both situations were due to terrible government policies.
First Republic is another big bank in the Bay Area that has competed aggressively with SVB for the startup market. It lost a lot of value, and I suspect its CEO will be talking to shareholders to shore up confidence soon.
