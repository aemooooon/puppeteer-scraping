The American Diabetes Association (ADA) released new standards of care for diagnosing and treating patients with diabetes, along with recommendations for assessing patients with measures other than their body mass index (BMI), and guidelines for popular weight loss medications.
“The latest ADA guidelines present pivotal updates for health care professionals, ensuring comprehensive, evidence-based care for diabetes management,” said Dr. Robert Gabbay, the ADA’s chief scientific and medical officer, in the Dec. 14 press release.
The ADA also recommends utilizing new technology to evaluate patients for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and fracture risk. Artificial intelligence can be used for retinal screenings and self-management education.
Additionally, the guidelines emphasize relying on newer technology for continuous glucose monitors and automated delivery systems to ensure patients are receiving the best care.
