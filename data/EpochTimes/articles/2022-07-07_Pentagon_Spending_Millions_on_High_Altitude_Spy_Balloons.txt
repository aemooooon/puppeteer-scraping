The Pentagon is investing tens of millions of dollars into high-altitude balloons that it intends to use for surveillance. It’s anticipated that the balloons will fly twice as high as most commercial aircraft and may be used one day soon to locate and track China’s hypersonic weapons.
Pentagon budget documents show that the technology is moving from the DOD’s scientific community to military service, according to the report. The DOD only spent $3.8 million on the projects over the past two years but is increasing funding for 2023 by up to $27.1 million.
The state-of-the-art balloons are solar-powered and use artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML) to navigate the skies while compiling complex data, and they’re likely to be piloted remotely by full-time flight engineers at a missions operation center. The AI-ML package allows the balloon to adequately navigate along its desired flight path by adjusting to wind in real-time.
