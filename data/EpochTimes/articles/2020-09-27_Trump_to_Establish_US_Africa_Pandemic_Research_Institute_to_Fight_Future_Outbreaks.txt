The White House has announced plans to establish a joint pandemic research institute between the United States and Africa, aiming to prevent future outbreaks of deadly diseases.
“The U.S.-Africa Institute will build the leadership and capacity of African health professionals, support African technological innovation, and create a data hub to support the rapid detection and mitigation of pandemics,” the press secretary said.
The chief aim of the endeavor is to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. HBCUs, which the White House called “a uniquely American asset,” will play a leading role in the Institute, which will also “complement longstanding United States investments and relationships, and usher in a new era of two-way partnership with the African continent.”
The United States has made more health-related investments in Africa in the past twenty years than any other nation.
“This COVID-19 specific assistance comes on top of long-term U.S. investment in Kenya, including $6.7 billion in health assistance alone, and more than $11.7 billion in development and other assistance over the last 20 years,” the U.S. Mission stated.
“The United States’ longstanding leadership in public health in Africa has generated extensive networks of labs, thousands of trained personnel, and has saved lives across the African continent,” the White House press secretary said.
Africa’s 54 countries estimate they need $100 billion in support annually for the next three years.
“Unfortunately,” Kabore said, “less than two months later, a fifth horseman of the apocalypse—very destructive, the coronavirus—has appeared.”
