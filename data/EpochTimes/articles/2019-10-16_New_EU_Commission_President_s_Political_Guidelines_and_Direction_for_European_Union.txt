“You will coordinate the work on inclusion and building a genuine Union of equality and diversity,” wrote von der Leyen to Schinas.
The goal should achieved through culture and sports, she said. Schinas should also focus “on making education more accessible and inclusive, on lifelong learning and on cross-border learning,” wrote von der Leyen. She also requested him to collaborate with the Commissioner for Jobs in the area of resolving skill shortages and reskilling. His responsibilities will include coordination of work on “improving the integration of migrants and refugees into society.”
“Accepting those that come from far away… is part of the European way of life.”
