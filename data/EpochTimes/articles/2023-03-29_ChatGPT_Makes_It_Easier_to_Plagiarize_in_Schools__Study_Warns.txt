The rollout and subsequent popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT has brought with it significant stresses in the education sector, with concerns about academic honesty and plagiarism brought to the forefront following the adoption of such technology.
“One challenge with using GPT-3 for assessment in higher education is the possibility of plagiarism,” the paper said. “AI essay-writing systems are designed to generate essays based on a set of parameters or prompts. This means that students could potentially use these systems to cheat on their assignments by submitting essays that are not their own work.”
Academic staff and exam evaluators find it difficult to distinguish between answers derived by the student and those produced by a chatbot.
“This undermines the very purpose of higher education, which is to challenge and educate students, and could ultimately lead to a devaluation of degrees,” the paper said.
But near the end of the paper in the “discussion” section, the researchers—Debby R. E. Cotton of Marjon University and Peter A. Cotton and J. Reuben Shipway of Plymouth University—revealed that everything preceding the discussion section, including the excerpts highlighted above, had been generated using ChatGPT.
“For example, they may use natural language processing algorithms to analyze the language and style of submitted work and identify any anomalies that may indicate the use of ChatGPT or other AI language models,” it says.
In order to detect AI work, the instructors can look for patterns and irregularities in the language as chatbots currently have limited language abilities, and their method of output suggests a nonhuman quality. Chatbots cannot be relied on to generate original, unique and innovative content.
Hence, checking for originality should be part of test assessment.
Since its public release in November 2022, the tool has garnered hundreds of millions of users in record time initiating an AI race. The latest version of the language model system is GPT-4 with free and premium versions.
