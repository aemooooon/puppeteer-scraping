The Biden administration is championing the news that the U.S. economy created 216,000 new jobs in December, and the unemployment rate remained below 4 percent for the 23rd straight month, with officials suggesting that the country has achieved a soft landing.
Last year, the government created 676,000 new jobs, representing about a quarter of job creation. The government produced an average of 56,000 jobs a month, more than double the average monthly gain of 23,000 in 2022, the BLS noted in its report.
New government jobs outnumbered new jobs in health care (600,000), leisure and hospitality (367,000), construction (171,000), retail (43,000), and manufacturing (1,000).
This development is negatively affecting the private sector, according to RedBalloon CEO Andrew Crapuchettes.
Twenty-five percent of this report’s job gains come from the government.
“That’s an amazing statistic. Government jobs are eating the private sector alive,” he said.
Could government payrolls surpass private-sector employment? Although many of the public sector jobs have been recovered from the pandemic, recent end-of-year data did not provide much optimism for other industries.
It was also below the pre-pandemic level of about 63.5 percent.
The employment-to-population ratio for employees aged 25 to 54 tumbled in December.
Household survey data, a component of the BLS’s monthly jobs report that counts individuals with jobs only once, highlighted that the number of employed workers collapsed by 683,000 workers, the largest decline since the country was shut down.
Economists note that the number of people dropping out of the workforce is artificially lowering the unemployment rate.
In addition to more people exiting the labor market, the number of full-time jobs cratered at record levels. According to BLS data, the number of full-time jobs plummeted by more than 1.53 million to 133.2 million. This was also the sharpest tumble since the COVID-era crash of nearly 15 million positions.
At the same time, the number of part-time positions climbed by 762,000 to 27.794 million, the highest level since March 2018.
Meanwhile, a record number of people are working two or more jobs. In December, there were a record 8.565 million multiple jobholders, up 222,000 from the previous month.
In total, 2023 saw revisions totaling 488,000. The final tally could be higher if the BLS revises the December payrolls report next month.
“Repeated downward revisions of previous months in ‘23 made initial job gains look larger than they were,” Mr. Antoni added on X.
With revisions being prevalent over the past year, economist Mike Shedlock is already looking to the January jobs data.
But can U.S. labor stay resilient in 2024?
Preston Caldwell, the chief economist at Morningstar, said he expects the first half of 2024 to see a slowdown in employment as GDP growth sputters.
“We remain upbeat on labor force participation gains. Although the gains we expect after 2024 look modest, they’re actually quite optimistic when you consider aging demographics.”
