Meanwhile, Ms. Raimondo said she has told Beijing that “there can be no negotiation when it comes to matters of national security.” She added, “I have to use every tool in my toolbox to make sure our most sophisticated semiconductor chips, artificial intelligence models, never get into the hands of the Chinese military.”
Mr. Sullivan added, “President Biden has a long history with President Xi, and their conversations are direct, they’re straightforward, and President Biden believes there is no substitute for leader-to-leader, face-to-face diplomacy to manage this complex relationship.”
Ms. Ning added, “China views and handles its relations with the US in accordance with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping.”
“Mutual respect [means] stop badmouthing me for my acts of repression and misdeeds,” Mr. Yu wrote. “Peaceful coexistence [means] No need to resist me when I want to dominate the world with my own model of governance, at the expense of the existing global system of free trade and [international] law.”
