The government for now tested the AI software in the regions of Alpes-Maritimes, Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Ardèche, Rhône, Haute -Savoie, Vendée, Maine-et-Loire and Morbihan—but the officials say it plans to roll out nationwide.
“We are particularly targeting house extensions like verandas, but we have to be sure that the software can find buildings with a large footprint and not the dog kennel or the children’s playhouse,” the deputy director general at Délégation Générale des Finances Publiques, (DGFiP) Antoine Magnant, told Le Parisien newspaper.
“This is our second stage of research and will also allow us to verify if a property is empty and should no longer be taxed,” he reportedly added.
