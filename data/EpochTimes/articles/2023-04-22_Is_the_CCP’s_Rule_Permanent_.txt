That phoenix now boasts a formidable nuclear arsenal.
The CCP’s rapid military buildup could make it, like the eternal phoenix, a near-permanent fixture of the future. Nuclear weapons will deter the CCP’s foreign adversaries, and its techno-totalitarianism can quash internal dissent. No dictatorship as powerful as the CCP, or as technologically sophisticated, was ever defeated in war or by internal enemies.
Unlike the phoenix, however, the CCP seeks to speed the process of its “rejuvenation” by destroying, rather than just replacing, its predecessor. Like Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempts to vanquish democratic Ukraine, Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to demolish democracy not only in Taiwan but also globally.
The CCP is obviously beguiling to Beijing’s leadership, which controls its fearsome power. But for the rest of us, the CCP is a threat to our freedoms, liberties, and diverse cultures.
To save ourselves, we must be able to defend against China’s growing military, about which languid democracies in North America and Europe are finally becoming educated.
The Biden administration’s weak reaction to China’s military buildup is apparently to beg for more cooperation and assure Beijing publicly that despite all their transgressions, we aren’t targeting the CCP as a whole.
The CCP has proven time and again that it is an unreliable partner. What remains is a threat to the world, with which negotiations are untenable.
In Islamic mythology, the phoenix (anqa or simurgh) was perfection, as communism claims to be. But the anqa became a bane to humanity and had to be defeated.
The CCP, as brightly colored its plumage and mellifluous its cry, follows the same path.
