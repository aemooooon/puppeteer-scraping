Canadian astronauts will join the first space mission to the Moon in 2023.
“The Canadian Space Agency and NASA have signed the Gateway-treaty, a historic agreement that secures Canada’s role in the ambitious project.”
The Artemis programme involves a three-stage exploration mission that begins in 2021 with Artemis I, an uncrewed test flight of the new Orion spacecraft.
In 2024, the Artemis III mission will land the first woman and the next man on the Moon.
Bains said this programme will make Canada the second country ever, after the United States, to have an astronaut in deep space.
