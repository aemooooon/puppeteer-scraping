Glaser and his affiliates currently own approximately 38 percent of the outstanding shares of RealNetworks stock.
“While this offer initiates a process that will unfold over a period of time, we want to assure all of our agents and clients that business will continue as usual, and we expect there to be no change in the products, services, or support we provide,” said Glaser in a press statement.
Glaser did not give an explanation regarding why is pursuing this strategy, but a clue might have been dropped last week during RealNetworks’ first-quarter earnings call.
The company added that it did not intend to “disclose developments regarding this process unless and until the special committee and RealNetworks’ board of directors have approved a specific transaction or otherwise concluded its review of strategic alternatives.”
