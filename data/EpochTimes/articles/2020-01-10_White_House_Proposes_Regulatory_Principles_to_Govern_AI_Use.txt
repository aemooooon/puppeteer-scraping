LAS VEGAS—The White House on Tuesday proposed regulatory principles to govern the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at limiting authorities’ “overreach,” and said it wants European officials to likewise avoid aggressive approaches.
The comments come at a time when companies are racing to integrate AI and deep machine learning into their businesses to remain competitive. However, the technology raises ethical concerns about control, privacy, cyber security, and the future of work, companies and experts have said.
Yet, he added, “despite this and other grave and documented actions that run counter to the values of America, Europe, and our allies, countries around the world continue to consider opening their arms to Chinese companies in order to build critical infrastructure, like 5G, or develop key technology, like artificial intelligence.
“If we don’t act now, Chinese influence and control of technology will not only undermine the freedoms of their own citizens, but all citizens of the world,” he warned.
As an example, the White House cited the Food and Drug Administration which is currently considering how to regulate the use of AI and machine learning technologies by medical device manufacturers.
The White House said, “Europe and our allies should avoid heavy handed innovation-killing models.” It added, “the best way to counter authoritarian uses of AI is to make sure America and our international partners remain the global hubs of innovation.”
The commission recommended increasing investment in AI technology and use in national security missions.
Kratsios, who will talk about the administration’s AI strategy at the CES trade show in Las Vegas later this week, said in a statement that Tuesday’s “principles set the nation on a path of continued AI innovation and discovery.”
