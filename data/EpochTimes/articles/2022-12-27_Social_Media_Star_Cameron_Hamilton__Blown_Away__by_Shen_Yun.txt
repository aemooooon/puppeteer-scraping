ATLANTA—Social media personality Cameron Hamilton said he felt blessed to be able to see Shen Yun Performing Arts at the Atlanta Symphony Hall on Dec. 26.
“It was just a great blessing to be here, to be able to experience it. ... You can just see when everyone came together—it was just a beautiful thing to see all this talent in one space,” Mr. Hamilton said.  “Everything from the dancing, to the musical orchestra, the solo acts—I mean I was blown away.”
After watching Shen Yun, Mr. Hamilton said he found inspiration from the performance.
“I’m sure we'll incorporate some element of our experience here today going forward with our videos,” he said.
“The biggest thing that came to mind while watching the show was elegance. It was really just the essence of elegance—watching the dancing, every movement was so fluid. I just felt very at peace watching the show,” he said.
Those who haven’t yet had the chance to see the performance “absolutely need to experience Shen Yun,” Mr. Hamilton added.
“It was incredible. I’ve been waiting for years to see it, and I am so glad I made it over to this show,” Mr. Chatmon said.
“I don’t know [why], but if you believe in spirituality, it’s something that connected with me. As the curtain opened up, I just cried,” he said after seeing Shen Yun on Dec. 26.
“It was terrific. I enjoyed the dance and the 3D effect—that was something unusual that I hadn’t seen before,” he said after seeing Shen Yun on Dec. 26.
“I love the 3D effect. It’s very nice,” Mr. Martin said.
