A man was arrested on Aug. 9 after allegedly assaulting a uniformed Secret Service officer outside the White House, an agency spokesperson said.
The assault took place around 12:30 p.m. in the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue NW, an area that is frequented by pedestrians and tourists hoping to see the White House.
A Secret Service spokesperson said in a statement to The Washington Post that the man “physically assaulted” a uniformed officer near a guard booth at 15th Street and that the attack was “without provocation.”
The officer did not receive any life-threatening injuries, the spokesperson said. The incident is being investigated and the identity of the person who was arrested was not immediately made public.
The Epoch Times has contacted the Secret Service for further comment.
Tuesday’s incident came shortly before President Joe Biden delivered remarks on the South Lawn of the White House as he signed the CHIPS and Science Act allocating a $280 billion funding package toward boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing and scientific research.
Specifically, the law will “strengthen American manufacturing, supply chains, and national security, and invest in research and development, science and technology, and the workforce of the future to keep the United States the leader in the industries of tomorrow, including nanotechnology, clean energy, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.”
While Democrats and other supporters of the law have touted its potential to improve jobs and national security by removing the United States’ dependence on foreign supply chains, critics argue that it amounts to a corporate handout as it would provide computer chip manufacturers with financial incentives to boost production in the country.
Critics also argue that the law could increase inflation, which stood at 9.1 percent in June, and be a burden to taxpayers.
