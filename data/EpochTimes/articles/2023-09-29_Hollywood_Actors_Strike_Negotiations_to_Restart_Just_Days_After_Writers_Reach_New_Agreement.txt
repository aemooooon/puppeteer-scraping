Hollywood actors currently on strike will continue negotiations with studios next week, just days after writers ended their own nearly five-month-long strike this week.
“As negotiations proceed, we will report any substantiative updates directly to you,” the union said. “We appreciate the incredible displays of solidarity and support from all of you over the last 76 days of this strike,” it added.
The governing boards of the eastern and western branches of the WGA both voted to accept the new three-year deal, which includes minimum pay increases of 5 percent, effective immediately, followed by another 4 percent increase in May 2024 and another 3.5 percent increase in May 2025.
Meanwhile, the Health Fund contributions on reportable earnings will also increase by a half percentage point, to 12 percent, in the second year of the new agreement.
Union members can, however, choose to use AI when performing writing services if the company consents.
After voting to accept the new agreement, WGA said writers could now go back to work starting at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
Hollywood actors have raised similar concerns in their strikes, which began in July, and have called for a larger slice of the revenue generated by streaming shows, as well as better working conditions and AI protections.
Earlier this month, the strike was expanded to include video game makers.
“The result of this vote shows our membership understands the existential nature of these negotiations, and that the time is now for these companies—which are making billions of dollars and paying their CEOs lavishly—to give our performers an agreement that keeps performing in video games as a viable career,” she added.
SAG-AFTRA was formed in 2012 following the merger of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
It represents roughly 160,000 actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, and more.
