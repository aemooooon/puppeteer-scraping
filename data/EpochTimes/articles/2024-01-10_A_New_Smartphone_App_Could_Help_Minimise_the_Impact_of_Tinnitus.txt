Researcher Suzanne Purdy explained that while traditional cognitive behavioural therapy is helpful for tinnitus, it usually requires the expertise of a trained psychologist.
“That’s expensive and often difficult to access,” she said.
In the first trial with 30 sufferers, nearly two-thirds saw a “clinically significant improvement.”
Michael Maslin, a New Zealand lecturer, clarified that while cognitive-behavioural therapy does not change the tinnitus sound, it helps manage symptoms by altering how the sound is perceived, making it less threatening.
