The bottom line is that this new “vaccine” isn’t like the kind we’ve always known in the past. And it’s understandable why many people don’t feel comfortable with a new type of vaccine that hasn’t undergone longitudinal studies.
On pages 126 and 127, she states, “Viruses are able to insert their DNA into the host’s cell nucleus and edit its genome, and so hacking the machinery of viruses has been pursued as a possible strategy to achieve beneficial gene editing.”
Contera wrote on page 128 that “nanoparticles can also be delivered through the nose.”
“Technology causes changes to our identity, our health, our biology ... and our perceptions of reality,” she wrote on page 177.
Contera is a professor of biological physics at Oxford and is also associate head of the Physics Department for equality, diversity, and inclusion. She advocates for nanotechnology and says ever-evolving identities will produce a more diverse future called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where physics—or artificial intelligence—and biology mesh together to create a new human species, also known as transhumanism.
However, is there proof of nanotechnology being used in new mRNA “vaccines”?
Could there be a correlation between mRNA technology and the introduction of ever-evolving gender identities, promoted through the California Department of Education? Since gender is at least partially controlled by DNA genes and nanotechnology can edit genes, then it’s logical to contemplate a correlation.
