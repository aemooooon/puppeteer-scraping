China’s artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have created the world’s first “robot wife,” touting it as a solution to the severe gender imbalance within China’s population.
The report described the robot wife as having unique facial features resembling a real human’s, with “skin” at a temperature close to that of a real human body. In addition, these AI “wives” can chat with humans and carry out household chores.
Clients can ask for customized orders for these robots, according to their specific requirements.
The report also claimed that in addition to being a sex robot, the AI “wife” can become someone’s real soulmate. “Now you can take a robot-AI wife home for just a little over 20,000 yuan [roughly $2,953]. There is no need to marry a real wife,” it said.
Li Yuanhua, a former associate professor of education at Capital Normal University in Beijing who now lives in Sydney, told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that the serious imbalance between men and women in China is caused by the Chinese regime’s forced implementation of the one-child policy.
According to China’s official statistics, there are currently 104.64 men to 100 women.
“Because of the imbalance of the male-to-female ratio, a large number of Chinese men cannot find a wife,” Li said.
“If further developments of this product include espionage functions, such as eavesdropping and taking videos, the user will have a live monitor in the residence,” Gu told the Chinese-language Epoch Times in a Feb. 17 interview.
“We human beings are created by God, we have flesh and soul. Robots are created by humans, and do not have souls!” one wrote. “The AI wife is the beginning of human destruction.”
Li Yuanhua believed that the emergence of this type of product is the result of moral degeneration.
