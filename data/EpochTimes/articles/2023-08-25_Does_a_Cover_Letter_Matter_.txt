Anyone who’s ever been unemployed knows how much work goes into applying for a job. Looking online for the right position takes time. And then once found, you must write a resume that thoroughly highlights your accomplishments. But it doesn’t stop there. You often must customize a cover letter.
For example, if you have a gap between jobs, you can take the question of “why” out of the recruiter’s mind by explaining why it’s there. It could strengthen your cause if you were taking a course or obtaining other experience related to the current position.
A strong cover letter will show that when, in that sales position you noted on your resume, you were able to increase revenue. A cover letter allows you to translate this accomplishment into filling a need the potential employer has.
You’ll list certifications on your resume, but a cover letter will explain how those certifications apply to the open position.
A cover letter should highlight any link you have to the company. If you know a high-ranking manager or have a relative within the company, that should be in your cover letter. It may help, but at least it will show you’re transparent.
Not reading the job description and explaining skills or education that don’t relate to the position can hurt you.
