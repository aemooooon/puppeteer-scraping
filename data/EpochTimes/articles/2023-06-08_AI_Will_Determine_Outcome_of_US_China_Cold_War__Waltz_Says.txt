Ongoing competition between China and the United States for next-generation technologies will define the future of artificial intelligence (AI), according to one U.S. congressman.
AI, in turn, will determine the outcome of the New Cold War between the two powers, said Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.).
The only way to ensure U.S. victory in the AI race, and thus the New Cold War, he believes, is to sever ties between the two nations’ tech sectors.
“I just don’t see a path forward without decoupling,” Waltz said during a June 5 talk with the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
Despite the growing fear that so-called “breakout moments” in AI “could prove to be very dangerous,” Waltz said, the United States may need to embrace less regulation of the technology in favor of accelerating its advanced technology development.
“I would take an unregulated or less-than-ideally regulated Western-developed AI, rather than a Chinese Communist Party [CCP] techno-dictatorship-developed AI, that has the potential to dominate both militarily and economically, if those are our two bad options,” Waltz said.
The United States and CCP have taken different paths on the issue.
Waltz said that limiting U.S. development of lethal AI for the military could hinder its competitive advantage.
“Our adversaries, I think, will have no issue removing humans from the loop if it gives them a critical first-mover advantage,” Waltz said.
“Humans in the loop, in any fashion ... will continue to prove to be a hindrance [and] will put us at a disadvantage.”
Though controversial, Waltz said that few would have urged the United States to cease its nuclear development to counter the Soviet Union. AI development, he said, is just as important.
