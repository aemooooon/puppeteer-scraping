The news comes as one of its units also said on March 22 that unnamed creditors have seized $2 billion of the company’s bank deposits held as collateral on its loans.
In a stock exchange filing, Evergrande said that “drastic changes” to the company’s operating environment had led its auditor to put a number of additional audit procedures in place. Together with the impact of COVID-19, the firm claimed, these revisions to the audit requirements have made Evergrande unable to complete the procedures by the deadline.
Evergrande, with over $300 billion in liabilities, defaulted on some overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors and complete projects and homes.
In a separate filing on Tuesday, Evergrande said its Property Services Group had launched an investigation into how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in deposits that had been pledged as security for third-party guarantees.
The firm set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring.
