WASHINGTON—TikTok, a video-sharing mobile application, reportedly accepted a bid from Oracle for its U.S. business, rejecting the other contender Microsoft.
President Donald Trump earlier set a mid-September deadline for TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell the app’s American operations.
Microsoft Corp. on Sept. 13 confirmed in a statement that its bid was rejected.
“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft,” the statement said.
“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests. To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement. We look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas.”
TikTok received bids from Oracle and also Microsoft in partnership with Walmart.
“I told them that they have till Sept. 15 to make a deal. After that we close it up in this country,” Trump told reporters on Sept. 1.
He said that the U.S. Treasury must be “well-compensated” in any agreement.
The Epoch Times has reached out to Oracle for comment.
The platform, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd., has come under bipartisan scrutiny over national security and privacy concerns.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business on Aug. 31 that China’s restriction of tech export is ironic considering much of China’s AI technology came from Google and Microsoft.
“TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including Internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories,” Trump’s executive order stated.
This data collection could allow “China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.”
The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Armed Forces have already barred TikTok on government devices.
TikTok has also met with criticism from users for censoring content concerning protests in Hong Kong and the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.
The Epoch Times recently reported that more than 130 ByteDance employees are part of a Chinese Community Party (CCP) committee embedded in the company. Many of these employees hold managerial positions, according to internal documents.
Besides TikTok and WeChat, the Trump administration could crack down on other China-based apps, according to Navarro.
