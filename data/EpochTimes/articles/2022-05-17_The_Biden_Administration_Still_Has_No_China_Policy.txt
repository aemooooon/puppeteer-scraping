The Chinese regime knows exactly where it stands on the United States, but the Biden administration has yet to declare where it stands on China.
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a U.S. policy and is moving on it.
In February, the administration released its Indo-Pacific strategy, with prominent mentions regarding China. It primarily focused on defending the Indo-Pacific region from the CCP. Conversely, President Joe Biden’s China-specific policy has been piecemeal, and the war in Ukraine has distracted the White House from focusing on China.
The CCP’s initiatives are highly targeted and aimed at the United States. A 2021 U.S. State Department report on the development of the Chinese military identified China as “the only competitor capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.”
