While this AI [artificial intelligence] tool showed promise for accurate early diagnosis, it also revealed chemicals that were strongly linked to a correct prediction.
Drawing on blood data from the EPIC study, the AI tool was then used to conduct 100 “experiments” and we assessed the accuracy of 100 different models for predicting Parkinson’s.
Our bodies can contain thousands of metabolites and their concentrations can differ significantly between healthy people and those affected by disease.
Our research identified a chemical, likely a triterpenoid, as a key metabolite that could prevent Parkinson’s disease. It was found the abundance of triterpenoid was lower in the blood of those who developed Parkinson’s compared to those who did not.
More research using different methods and looking at larger populations is needed to further validate these results.
The burden of living with the disease can be intolerable.
