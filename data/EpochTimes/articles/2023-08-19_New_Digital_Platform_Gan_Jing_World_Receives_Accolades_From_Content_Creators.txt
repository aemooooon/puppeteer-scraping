Gan Jing World has received praise from its users since the social media platform was launched in June 2022. A spokesperson told The Epoch Times about the company’s mission in creating a “clean” and family-friendly platform.
“Gan Jing” comes from Chinese, meaning “clean” in English. Founded by Silicon Valley executives and Chinese dissidents who fled communist China, the company seeks to provide a new form of “clean” social media, which it believes to be essential in helping communities thrive.
In March, his parents filed a lawsuit against TikTok in Suffolk County Supreme Court in New York, claiming their 16-year-old son was “targeted, overwhelmed and actively goaded” into taking his own life.
“The TikTok defendants know that violent, dangerous, extreme and psychologically disturbing content triggers a greater dopamine response in minors than safe and benign content,” the 91-page complaint said.
“Through our channel on Gan Jing World, we hope to promote traditional culture, and many of the contents are suitable for children and teenagers to watch. We aim to showcase purity, goodness, and beauty when crafting our videos, encapsulating traditional historical narratives, characters, and events with exquisite visuals.
“Each story is meticulously created with utmost dedication, driven by our unwavering commitment to achieving nothing less than perfection and a sense of unadulterated authenticity. Gan Jing World is a clean and healthy social media platform that is very suitable for placing the academy’s works,” Ms. Zeng said.
She told the publication that the school had tried other social media platforms but received very little feedback or subscriptions.
In an interview with The Epoch Times on Aug. 12, Mr. Zhou said, “I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to produce content on this platform.”
Furthermore, Mr. Zhou mentioned that he enjoys much freedom when producing programs on Gan Jing World.
