Billionaire Elon Musk expressed his concern about threats to freedom of speech online and warned that big tech firms like Facebook and Google have been manipulating elections globally for some time.
To suppress the New York Post report, executives marked the story as “unsafe,” thereby limiting its spread and even blocking it from being shared through Twitter’s direct messaging function. Such severe restrictions are usually reserved for content like child pornography, Taibbi noted.
The Twitter owner pointed out that tech companies like Facebook, Google, and YouTube have “put their thumb on the scale of elections worldwide.”
“And they have done for some time. And a lot of times, it’s so subtle you don’t even really notice it. Frankly, Google might be the most pernicious in that it’s very easy for them to slightly de-rank a search, so it’s on page four or five if you’re looking for something. And nobody ever goes there.”
“And I think, probably, the more we worry about a bad outcome, the less likely it is to occur. So, I think we should just try to steer the AI in a good direction.”
According to Musk, the initial Neuralink devices will focus on restoring functionality to people who have lost the connection between their body and brain, like a quadriplegic. The second application will seek to restore eyesight to people who have gone blind.
“You can take an alley cat or something like a bobcat, like some like wild creature that would normally be quite fierce and unfriendly and like kill anything it came across. But the moment it has cubs or puppies or kittens, it becomes a loving mom. The cat that was really mean is like taking care of its little kittens.”
“It’s Instinct. It’s genetic programming. So, people should really expect that if they have kids, they will improve their quality of life, not make it worse,” Musk stated.
