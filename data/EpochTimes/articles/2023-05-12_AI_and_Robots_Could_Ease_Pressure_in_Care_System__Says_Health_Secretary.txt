Smart technology can provide better and faster care for the elderly, while easing pressure on staff, according to Health Secretary Steve Barclay.
Ahead of his trip to the G-7 Summit in Nagasaki, Japan, Barclay spoke about the role of robots and AI technology in supporting patients in care homes across the UK.
“I think there’s a space to look at what is working in other health care systems. Do we have the humility to learn from that and see what we can adopt? There may be space to do that within robots, but it may also be particularly around AI,” he said.
“Looking at the examples in Japan where it may be on robotics, it may be on artificial intelligence, it may be other areas where technology is helping both to support patients in the care home, in their own home, and also avoid some of those visits to emergency departments, because once frail, elderly people are admitted to hospital, often they end up staying for a significant length of time,” Barclay added.
Rapid population ageing in Japan and the shortage of caregivers boosted research in the field of robotics in elderly care. By 2018, the Japanese government had spent over $300 million in funding research and development for such devices.
AI and robotics could be part of the solution to the issue of overstretched hospitals and understaffed care homes.
The NHS has been dealing with a high number of A&E attendances and long waiting lists for urgent and non-urgent care during and after the pandemic. Currently, the maximum waiting time for non-urgent, consultant-led treatments is 18 weeks.
Barclay admitted that one of the key challenges within the UK is “frail, elderly patients admitted to emergency departments when often care can be better delivered earlier.”
Barclay suggested robots and AI can help in better supporting patients and reducing demand on health and social care staff.
With one in seven people in the UK now expected to be over 75 years old by 2040, the government has been looking to automate elder care as the solution.
Faced with a shortage of care staff, in 2019 the government invested £34 million in the “biggest research programme entirely dedicated to making autonomous systems safe and trustworthy for public use.”
The investment is set to help develop robots that could help “an elderly person up after a fall and raising the alarm, delivering food to an older person at mealtimes, and even ensuring they take crucial medication at the correct time.”
