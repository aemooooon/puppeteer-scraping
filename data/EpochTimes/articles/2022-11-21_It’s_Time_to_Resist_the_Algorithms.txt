Let’s face it: Algorithms are good and getting even better.
Everything from what you see on your Instagram feed, the product recommendations you get on Amazon, the videos you’re shown on YouTube, and the specific directions given to you by Google Maps are shaped by powerful algorithms that process large amounts of data to give you an experience that’s uniquely tailored to your preferences.
A world without algorithms would mean less of many good things we’ve come to enjoy and would be an immediate step backward in terms of convenience and personalization.
But I worry that we’re reinforcing a culture that puts far too much importance on comfort, novelty, and convenience at the expense of other traits linked to a healthy, dynamic society—like risk-taking, adventure, and an independent spirit.
Instead of nurturing the next generation of ambitious go-getters and entrepreneurs, we’re growing more and more complacent. Eventually, this bill will come due.
At the margin, I think we need more people strategically and creatively resisting the algorithmic way of life, even while acknowledging the important role that algorithms will play in our future.
I think it’s amazing that so many of us now live in a world of food abundance. In the past 100 years, food has gotten cheaper, tastier, and more convenient than ever before in history. I celebrate this accomplishment and hope for the trend to continue.
The solution is not to go back to a world before all these advances were made, but rather to cultivate a collective set of values that pushes back against the dangers of processed food abundance, while leaving ample space to enjoy the blessings of natural foods. Practices like exercise, fasting, growing our own food, and eating a balanced diet would seem to fit the bill.
The case against algorithms follows a similar vein. In order to benefit from and thrive in a world of automation, convenience, and yes, algorithms, we need to push back against the complacency they encourage.
