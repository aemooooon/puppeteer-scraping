Republican lawmakers have proposed legislation that would bar Chinese nationals from receiving visas for graduate or post-graduate study in science and technology in the United States.
Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), and Rep. David Kustoff (Tenn.) unveiled the bill on May 27, saying the measure was a response to Chinese state-sanctioned academic espionage and intellectual property (IP) theft on U.S. college campuses.
Chinese nationals who belong to religious or ethnic groups suppressed by the CCP would be exempted from these measures, as well as applicants from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Cotton told Fox News in April that it was a “scandal” that the United States has trained some Chinese nationals to “go back to China to compete for our jobs, to take our business, and ultimately to steal our property and design weapons and other devices that can be used against the American people.”
“If Chinese students want to come here and study Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers, that’s what they need to learn from America,” Cotton said. “They don’t need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.”
Some critics, however, say that targeting all students from China would be racist and excessive.
