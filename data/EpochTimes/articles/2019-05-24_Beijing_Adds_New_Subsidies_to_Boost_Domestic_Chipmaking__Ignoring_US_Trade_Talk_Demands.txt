One of the longstanding U.S. demands in the stalled Sino-U.S. trade talks is that Beijing end the massive government subsidies granted to Chinese companies, which U.S. firms say make it difficult for them to compete in the Chinese market on a level playing field.
However, recently introduced Chinese semiconductor policies reveal that Beijing isnâ€™t making progress on U.S. demands.
The 2012 policy stated that newly-founded IC and software companies, as well as existing IC companies whose IC products are less than 0.8 microns in size, would be exempt from paying any corporate income tax for the first and second fiscal years. From the third until fifth fiscal years, they can enjoy paying only half of the legally required 25 percent corporate tax. The tax reduction policy applies to all corporate earnings prior to Dec. 31, 2017, and lasts for five years.
Qualifying companies that already paid taxes prior to 2012 are eligible to get tax returns.
The extension announced on May 17 pushed forward the cut-off date to Dec. 31, 2018, so that more companies could potentially qualify.
Regional governments have also announced similar measures to boost their local tech industries in the past month.
On May 15, the district government in Xiangzhou, which is located in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, announced about a dozen different subsidy programs to boost local IC companies. For example, companies that have spent money on buying up intellectual property rights are entitled to a maximum of 2 million yuan (about $289,000) in annual subsidies.
