China is the world’s most vicious tyranny. But for all its wrongdoing, the country faces virtually no accountability. To the contrary, China is treated as a respected member of the international community, even granted the honor of hosting the Winter Olympics, which start on Feb. 4, 2022.
How can this be? One would think nations that claim the mantle of human rights champions would protest the ongoing atrocities in China by refusing to participate in the Winter Games. Yes, it would thwart the dreams of athletes. But that would be the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) fault for selecting China as host, not wrongdoing by a righteously disgusted world community.
And what an excellent example of soft power a boycott would provide. Refusing to attend the Olympics would be a bloodless—but sharp and salutary message—that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) brutal ways are beyond the pale.
But no. The international community can’t even manage that symbolic protest. The best the United States could do was declare a “diplomatic boycott”—which merely means that we won’t be sending Vice President Kamala Harris to Beijing to cheer on our athletes. I am sure the CCP’s Politburo is shedding bitter tears.
Make no mistake: The head of the United Nations attending the Olympics validates China. Yet, this is the same man who bitterly criticized temporary travel restrictions from Africa announced by several countries to prevent the spread of the Omicron COVID variant. Good grief, how misplaced can his priorities get?
