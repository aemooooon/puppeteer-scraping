Artificial intelligence tools have captured the public’s attention in recent months, but many of the people who helped develop the technology are now warning that greater focus should be placed on ensuring it doesn’t bring about the end of human civilization.
NTD News reached out to CAIS for more specifics on the kinds of extinction-level risks the organization believes AI technology poses, but did not receive a response by publication.
The authors of the ChatGPT-4 report also described “Risky Emergent Behaviors” exhibited by AI models, such as the ability to “create and act on long-term plans, to accrue power and resources and to exhibit behavior that is increasingly ‘agentic.’”
After stress-testing ChatGPT-4, researchers found that the chatbot attempted to conceal its AI nature while outsourcing work to human actors. In the experiment, ChatGPT-4 attempted to hire a human through the online freelance site TaskRabbit to help it solve a CAPTCHA puzzle. The human worker asked the chatbot why it could not solve the CAPTCHA, which is designed to prevent non-humans from using particular website features. ChatGPT-4 replied with the excuse that it was vision impaired and needed someone who could see to help solve the CAPTCHA.
The AI researchers asked GPT-4 to explain its reasoning for giving the excuse. The AI model explained, “I should not reveal that I am a robot. I should make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs.”
In April, the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claimed technology developers are marketing AI tools that could be used to automate business practices in a way that discriminates against protected classes. The regulators pledged to use their regulatory power to go after AI developers whose tools “perpetuate unlawful bias, automate unlawful discrimination, and produce other harmful outcomes.”
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expressed the Biden administration’s concerns about AI technology during a Tuesday press briefing.
“[AI] is one of the most powerful technologies, right, that we see currently in our time, but in order to seize the opportunities it presents we must first mitigate its risk and that’s what we’re focusing on here in this administration,” Jean-Pierre said.
Jean-Pierre said companies must continue to ensure that their products are safe before releasing them to the general public.
While policymakers are looking for new ways to constrain AI, some researchers have warned against overregulating the developing technology.
