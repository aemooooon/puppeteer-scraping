Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used by the NHS, in some cases to track people’s eating and drinking habits in their homes, to prevent avoidable hospital admissions.
The NHS unveiled a suite of AI initiatives across England on Tuesday, aiming to stop unnecessary hospitalisations during the busy winter period.
Onward Care project director Adrian McCourt in the video says that the technology “uses artificial intelligence so that we can identify whether someone’s behaviour is changing and if that behaviour is changing, we'll get a notification, that means that we can act proactively to check what is happening with that individual.”
Sensors on fridges and kettles are used as “proxies for hydration and nutrition.”
“They are identifying the most at-risk or vulnerable patients and wider issues affecting their health, so teams can get to them early and help avoid an unnecessary visit to hospital—not only are these measures better for patients who can be cared for at home where they feel most comfortable but they are good for the NHS too, particularly when we know that this winter is likely to be incredibly challenging.”
Chris Holt, chief transformation officer at Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS FT, said: “Using data more smartly and harnessing the power of AI is now crucial in supporting the highest risk patients who, with the right support, can stay well at home.
