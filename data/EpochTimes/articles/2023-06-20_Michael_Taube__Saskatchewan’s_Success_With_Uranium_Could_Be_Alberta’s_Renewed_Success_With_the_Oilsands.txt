Saskatchewan, one of the world’s leading sources of uranium production, recently announced a significant achievement.
Moe’s tweet went on to say, “With production expected to almost double in Saskatchewan this year, this increase ensures more jobs and opportunities for people right here at home. That’s growth that works for everyone.”
Saskatchewan, which employed 1,842 people in uranium production in 2021, is “currently expected to produce 15 million kilograms of yellowcake, almost double last year’s number.” If this estimate materializes in 2023, Canada could ultimately become as competitive with Kazakhstan’s uranium production as it was between 2015 and 2017.
Alberta’s oilsands is a prime example.
That’s great, but there’s a significant issue that remains unresolved.
Why has oilsands development been so limited in Alberta?
Tending to the oilsands’ unproven reserves would undoubtedly increase overall oil production in Alberta and Western Canada. It would also substantially increase overall profits, and lead to more drilling expeditions, domestic and international investment, and job opportunities for Canadians.
