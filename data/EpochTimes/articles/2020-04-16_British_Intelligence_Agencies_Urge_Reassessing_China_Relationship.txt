Britain’s intelligence agencies called for restrictions on Chinese takeovers of UK tech firms.
“What we think is going on is the Chinese are trying to export the technology base from here to China and that’s inappropriate,” David Davis, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party, told Reuters on April 14.
Canyon Bridge is in turn backed by Chinese state-owned China Reform Holdings.
China Reform had attempted to take control of Imagination’s board by appointing members who would support them.
A board meeting that was scheduled last Tuesday was delayed after the British government intervened, Reuters reported.
Imagination announced on April 10 that its chief executive officer, Ron Black, had stepped down and would be replaced by Ray Bingham.
He added that the tactic would undermine the UK firm “perhaps fatally” and suggested that the Chinese might move the company and its 600 jobs to China.
Davis said the British government should ensure that Imagination’s technology base does not transfer to China, and should even look for a Western buyer for the company, according to Reuters.
