The Pentagon is stepping up the production of thousands of autonomous systems to compete with China’s military, which outnumbers the United States in personnel, ships, artillery, and land-based missiles.
The project, known as the Replicator Initiative, was announced by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks at a conference of the National Defense Industrial Association on Aug. 28.
“With smart people, smart concepts, and smart technology, our military will be more nimble, with uplift and urgency from the commercial sector.”
Thus, to counter the threat posed by China’s communist regime and to prevent a war for Taiwan, Ms. Hicks said the DOD would surge unmanned capabilities across the military.
The CCP has also launched the Zhu Hai Yun, a 290-foot ocean research vessel designed to deploy underwater and airborne drones for various purposes. The ship itself is a drone and can be remotely controlled by a pilot or left to navigate the open seas autonomously using artificial intelligence (AI).
In the words of its manufacturer, it is the “world’s first intelligent unmanned system mother ship.”
“That’s coming. Those changes, that technology ... we are looking at inside of 10 years.”
To that end, Gen. Milley said the United States has “five to seven years to make some fundamental modifications to our military” because the nation’s adversaries, including the CCP, are seeking to deploy robotics and AI in the same manner.
As such, the nation that is the first to deploy robotics and AI together in a cohesive way is likely to dominate the next war. The Replicator Initiative appears to be one large push toward achieving that dominance.
