Australia and India have agreed to a new partnership that pledges closer cooperation between the two countries in the fields of science and technology, and defence and maritime security.
Speaking at the summit, India’s prime minister said India and Australia relations are deep and that the two countries had a duty “to uphold and protect values for global good like democracy, rule of law, freedom, mutual respect, regard for international institutions and transparency.”
Responding, Morrison said that he believed Australia and India share a “vision for an open, free, rules-based multilateral system in our region.”
Minister for Defence Senator Linda Reynolds said in a media release on June 4 that India and Australia have a keen interest in a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.
According to Payne, the focus of the partnership will be the development of digital trade, cyber-security, and critical technologies.
“Critical technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and robotics present significant opportunities for people, businesses and the broader economy,” said Payne.
Payne noted, however, that they must be guided by international standards to ensure they do not present risks to any country.
Consequently, India and Australia will build a research and development fund for Indian and Australian businesses and researchers, and other countries to improve their cyber resilience.
