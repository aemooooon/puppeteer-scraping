More than 20 Republican House lawmakers have sent a joint letter to the White House, calling on President Joe Biden to prioritize cooperation with U.S. allies on emerging technologies in order to confront threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
These technologies include artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductor chips, and 5G communications.
“it is critical that the United States cooperates with our allies to scale the development and deployment of these emerging technologies in order to challenge China’s goal of total global technology leadership and tech authoritarianism.”
In the joint letter, the lawmakers asked the Joe Biden administration to take action to protect U.S. economic and national security interests, such as by prioritizing issues regarding Chinese technologies at summits of the Group of Seven (G7), as well as within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan house the biggest semiconductor chipmakers outside of the United States.
The letter called for the administration to promote “the development of an allied network to encourage cooperation among tech companies in allied states to scale emerging technology advancements.”
The lawmakers also called on the Biden administration to coordinate with allies and like-minded states to “advance fair and ethical technology standards at international standards-setting bodies.”
Other House lawmakers that signed the letter included Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), and Micahel McCaul (R-Texas).
“I strongly encourage the Biden Administration to take charge by prioritizing critical technologies, like semiconductor manufacturing, in its infrastructure plan,” McCaul said. “This includes investing in domestic manufacturing of next-generation semiconductor chips as outlined by my CHIPs for America Act.”
