China’s Baidu announced it will complete the internal testing of Ernie Bot (Chinese name: Wenxin Yiyan), a ChatGPT-style AI project, in March and open it to the public. However, some experts are not optimistic about Baidu’s product due to the ubiquitous censorship of “sensitive words” under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule.
On Feb. 7, Baidu Inc confirmed that Ernie Bot, its language model-based chatbot product, will complete internal testing and be available to the public in March.
ChatGPT, which is backed by Microsoft, offers Chinese services. However, Ren Jun, Baidu’s product manager, believes that the China-based company has its own strength.
“For example, AI painting can be done by many companies at home and abroad, but Baidu understands the Chinese language system better,” Ren told Caixin, a Chinese financial publication, on Jan. 6.
Speaking to The Epoch Times on Feb. 9, Japan-based electronics engineer Li Jixin said he was “not optimistic” about Baidu’s product competing with ChatGPT, not only because of the technology gap, but also because of the “sensitive words” identified by the CCP.
“Such AI chat software is based on extensive training to complete conversations automatically. Once the training is complete, even the engineers who designed the software can’t predict what the AI software will say,” Li said. “The CCP has long been engaged in [an] information blockade, and there are sensitive words everywhere, so the CCP will think that such AI software without ‘party spirit' will bring risks to its rule.”
Li analyzed that three methods can be used to prevent AI software from saying sensitive words: manual censorship, which requires enormous manpower and degrades AI to artificial; censorship of AI software training materials, which will result in poor performance of the software; and simply shutting down AI software when it is out of control.
“No matter which one is used, AI chat software will not develop well due to the CCP’s censorship of speech,” he said.
The report, based on information from data provider Crunchbase, also pointed out that early-stage venture funding can provide benefits beyond capital, such as technical guidance, increased corporate visibility, and networking.
“For American investors, it’s true that over the last 20 to 30 years there have been many successful examples of Chinese companies imitating American companies, such as Baidu imitating Google, Tencent QQ imitating ICQ, and Alibaba and Taobao imitating eBay. They have all been hugely successful and benefited American investors,” Li Jixin said.
“However, things are different now. The underlying investment environment for Chinese companies has changed dramatically.”
“In terms of the international environment, as U.S.-China relations deteriorate, geopolitical and investment risks increase, the channel for Chinese companies to list in the United States becomes more and more narrow, and it is difficult for U.S. investors to make profits as quickly as in previous years.”
In addition, the CCP’s “extremely opaque” policies make it “impossible for investors to predict corporate trends, increasing investment risks,” according to Li.
On Jan. 11, 2023, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology once again stressed the importance of developing AI at the national work conference and vowed to implement the “Robot Plus” plan nationwide, encouraging local governments that meet the conditions to take the initiative.
While the CCP has been trying to catch up with the United States in AI in recent years, things seem to be turning against its goal.
The United States ranked first in overall strength with a score of 80.7, according to the report. China came in second, with a composite score of 72.5, 8.2 points behind the United States. Compared to its 2021 composite score, China lost 2.1 points.
