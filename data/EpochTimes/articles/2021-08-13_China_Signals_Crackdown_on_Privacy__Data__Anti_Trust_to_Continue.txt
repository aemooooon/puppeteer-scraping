BEIJING—The Chinese regime will draft new laws on national security, technology innovation, monopolies, and education, as well as in areas involving foreigners, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese State Council said in a document published late on Wednesday.
The announcement signals that a crackdown on industry with regard to privacy, data management, antitrust, and other issues will persist through the year.
The CCP and the Chinese State Council said in a blueprint for the five years to 2025, published by the state-run Xinhua news agency, that they would also change legislation around public health by amending the infectious disease law and the “frontier health and quarantine law.”
Regulations dealing with food and medicine, natural resources, industrial safety production, urban governance, and transport, would also be affected.
Authorities say they will aim to develop laws consistent with new sectors such as the digital economy, Internet finance, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, adding that they would also improve the response to emergencies.
They additionally laid out directives regarding social conflicts.
The Chinese regime has in recent months reined in tech giants with anti-monopoly or data security rules and clamped down on tutoring companies, as the state increases its control of the economy and society.
On Thursday, state-media outlet the Securities Times reported that banking regulators would step up scrutiny of online insurance companies.
