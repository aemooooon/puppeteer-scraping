Google is introducing a “highly requested” AI search feature in its Gmail service amid concerns that artificial intelligence could pose a threat to privacy.
“This highly requested feature gives you the most relevant information first, allowing you to more quickly and easily find specific emails or files.” The Gmail AI search update began rolling out on June 2.
When she asked Google’s Bard AI where its dataset comes from, the artificial intelligence replied that one of the sources is Google’s internal data, including data from Gmail.
“I’m assuming that’s flat-out wrong; otherwise, Google is crossing some serious legal boundaries,” Crawford said at the time. Google later replied to the tweet that Bard was “not trained on Gmail data.”
The problem with AI having access to personal data is that artificial intelligence could end up manipulating human beings.
“It will be so much easier and cheaper to underscore visual material that it becomes ubiquitous … You see people walking around and basically wired in 24/7. They wake up to music, put in their headphones, and have their phone all day. Once they take it out, they’re in a shop which has music in the background,” he said.
“You’re not aware of it. That’s what makes it so manipulative because it ‘disappears,’ it literally becomes an underscore.”
“You can basically ask these tools to put themselves in a specific frame of mind and pretend to be essentially this person, pretend to have these characteristics.”
