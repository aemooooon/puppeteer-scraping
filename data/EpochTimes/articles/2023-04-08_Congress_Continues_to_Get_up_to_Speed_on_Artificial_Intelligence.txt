Members of Congress may be late to the table in learning about artificial intelligence (AI), but the lawmakers are committed to playing catchup.
The legislators are learning and thinking about AI, its present and future benefits, and its negative influences. They are figuring out what role Uncle Sam may play in developing and using the technology and phenomenon.
Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), 72, has returned to school as a part-time student at George Mason University to educate himself about AI and keep pace with developments in computer technology.
“I’m pursuing a graduate degree in computer science with emphasis on machine learning, and according to George Mason University, that’s the closest to quote unquote artificial intelligence,” Beyer told WTOP News.
Beyer is a member of the Congressional AI Caucus, which has about 40 members, but he believes that number could rise to 100 this summer.
AI developers and business users are cautiously and attentively viewing the political and legislator activity in Washington, D.C.
And businesses are using their lobbying and advocacy power on Capitol Hill to ward off excessive government intrusion and regulation, even as they acknowledge that not only will Congress have a say and role in the rollout of AI but that its measured and limited involvement may actually be desirable and render benefits for the high tech industry and public.
In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has historically and energetically pushed, on behalf of business, less regulation and less government involvement, is calling for Congress to be a significant player in the rollout and implementation of AI.
In a press release issued on June 16, 2021, announcing that the bill had passed the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Obernolte said: “Computer science will be critical to the future of jobs in our country as well as an important facet of our national security, especially as our nation faces a wave of cyberattacks by foreign actors.
