The Trump administration wants the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to focus on deep space exploration, a departure from the prior administration’s focus on remote observation of the Earth and precise climate measurements.
It seems, at least, that this strategy paves the way for “CubeSats” or “SmallSats,” which are small spacecraft with similarly precise instruments as traditional crafts but can be launched as “ride along” payloads for existing launches deployed in constellations or solo.
Having a powerful flight computer will be a necessity as humans go to the moon and to Mars. In addition, it will be a key enabler for the agency’s autonomous capabilities, including its rovers, planetary drones, and other assets.
Considering that the United States’ own deficit continues growing upwards of $1 trillion, partnering between NASA and commercial space companies seems to be the only way to truly yield the technological advantages required to get to the moon and to Mars, and to do so without continuing to break the bank.
Considering these clear moves by leading nations in space to establish a presence on the moon and likely beyond, the United States should move quickly and boldly to implement the administration’s vision and to invest in the technologies to get us there, and to Mars, sooner rather than later.
