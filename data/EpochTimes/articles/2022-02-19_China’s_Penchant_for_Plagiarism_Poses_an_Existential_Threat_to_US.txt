Should we really be surprised by this blatant act of plagiarism?
Absolutely not.
It’s common knowledge that plagiarism is very much an established business model in China. This business model poses existential risks to a number of countries, most notably the United States.
This phenomenon of lifting ideas from successful foreign companies is known as “Copy to China”; it’s not very original, but it’s highly effective.
Last year, Elon Musk accused XPeng, one of China’s biggest electric car makers, of stealing old source codes from Tesla.
I could go on, but you get the picture.
Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe recently warned that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) plans to rob, replicate, and replace every one of America’s industries one by one.
If this sounds ridiculous, it really shouldn’t. Remember who you are dealing with, a country that builds cities faster than most places, including the United States, build bridges.
To reach its goal of technological supremacy, the CCP is currently employing “a wide variety of legal, quasi-legal, and illegal methods to acquire technology and know-how from the United States and other nations,” according to the report.
Not surprisingly, one of the “illegal methods” is the theft of U.S. intelligence.
When you think of places where Chinese espionage might be occurring, Arkansas doesn’t exactly spring to mind. But it should.
For years, he warned, “China has sought methods and means to be able to deprive the U.S. of any advances that it has made in technological areas.” In an effort to surpass the United States, the CCP “will spare no effort whatsoever.”
This is where decades of plagiarism have taken us. It started with China copying ideas from Google and Amazon.
