Beijing is taking steps to solidify its sphere of influence, including from close ally Russia, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping delivering a strong message during an official visit to Kazakhstan.
Xi told officials that China was keen to nurture relations with Kazakhstan and opposed any interference in the Central Asian country.
Kazakh authorities reached out to Russia for assistance while claiming that the unrest was sparked by an unknown foreign power.
“The militants have not laid down their arms; they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them,” President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a televised address. “Whoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill without warning.”
Government forces—backed by Russia—are still engaged with alleged national or foreign “bandits.”
“We had to deal with armed and trained bandits, both local and foreign. It is with bandits and terrorists. Therefore, they need to be destroyed. And this will be done shortly,” he said.
Tokayev also said he had ordered a nationwide communications blackout.
Eytan Goldstein, an East Asia expert, said the Central Asian country was a vital link for China to the Caspian Sea and beyond.
Currently, 80 percent of Kazakhstan’s oil exports are moved through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, where Russia holds a 31 percent stake.
Kazakhstan has also decided to not help Russia circumvent global economic sanctions launched by developed countries and has also banned Russian military propaganda symbols in the country.
At the same time, the Kazakh government has moved to be more heavily engaged with China in the past few months.
