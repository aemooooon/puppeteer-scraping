Scraping refers to the practice of collecting data across the internet to “train” AI programs to create their version of a work whether that is written text, images, or music.
Given that the majority of jobs purported to be at risk of replacement by AI involve technology, it may be blue-collar workers and industries that are protected, given the difficulty of replicating physical labour with machine learning.
“Three years ago, all the software programmers were saying, ‘Better learn how to code.’ If journalists lose their job—‘better learn how to code,’” Mr. Barrie said.
“The ironic thing is that it’s some of the software developers that might have to learn how to drive a truck,” he added.
Mr. Barrie did say, however, that while in the short-term jobs may be displaced, AI would spur new forms of employment that people could adapt to.
“If history is any guide, technology has always created more jobs than it displaced. I mean, cameras didn’t put painters out of a job,” Mr. Barrie said.
