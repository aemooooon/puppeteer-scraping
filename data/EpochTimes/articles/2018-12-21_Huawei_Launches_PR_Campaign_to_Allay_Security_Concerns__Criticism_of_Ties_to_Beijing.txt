Chinese telecom giant Huawei, already beleaguered by growing concerns that security loopholes in its products could expose Western governments and consumers to espionage by Beijing, recently received further scrutiny with the arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou.
Meng was arrested in Canada earlier this month at the request of U.S. authorities for allegedly skirting U.S. sanctions on Iran. The United States seeks her extradition to face trial.
The case has escalated into a diplomatic row after the Chinese regime detained three Canadian citizens working in China, apparently in retaliation for Meng’s arrest.
To battle the negative press and ease international concerns about the risks of doing business with Huawei, the company recently invited about two dozen journalists from international media outlets for a press conference at its headquarters in the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province.
For a company known for its opaque ownership and secrecy, it was a rare sight to have CEO Ken Hu address the crowd of international journalists on Dec. 18, which included staff from Bloomberg, The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and South Korean newspaper Joong Ang Daily.
The newspaper reported that Hu tried hard to allay concerns about Huawei’s close ties to the Chinese regime.
He added, “We have never received any requests from the Chinese government.”
Meanwhile, China’s mass surveillance system has drawn criticism from experts about its invasive monitoring of citizens.
At the press conference, Hu claimed that there was no documented example of Huawei’s security risks, and urged the public to provide such evidence.
“Without factual evidence, we don’t accept and we oppose those allegations,” he said, according to a Reuters report.
Hu tried to ease fears by announcing that Huawei would spend $2 billion over the next five years to focus on cybersecurity measures.
