Around 50 percent of donations to the Freedom Convoy anti-mandate protests in Canada have come from small donations made from the United States, according to the crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo.
In its campaign statement, Freedom Convoy blames the Canadian government for destroying businesses and livelihoods by imposing mandates. In November, the Trudeau administration insisted that cross-border travel will require a vaccine passport, something which Freedom Envoy says is controversial and unnecessary given the shortage of truckers.
The decision drove up the cost of transporting essential items like food imported into Canada from the United States, the group said.
In terms of individual donations, the United States topped the list. One of the biggest donations of $90,000 was made by billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur Thomas Siebel, founder of Siebel Systems and C3.ai, an artificial intelligence platform.
