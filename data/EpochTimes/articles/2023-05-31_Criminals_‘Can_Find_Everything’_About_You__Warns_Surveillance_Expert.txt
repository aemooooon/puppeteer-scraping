Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced to such a level that criminals can now surveil and know “everything” about their targets, including predicting where the targets could be at some point in the future, experts warn.
“So, for example, if you run into someone in public, and you’re able to get a photo of them, you might be able to find their name using online services. And if you pay enough, you might be able to find where they’ve been, where they might currently be, and even predict where they'll go.”
Pimeyes collects the target’s photos from websites, news articles, photo-sharing sites, and blog posts. The tool also returns URLs that lead back to the sources where the images were initially posted.
The company had built a face search engine by scraping images containing people’s faces from the web and social media. Clearview AI is said to have collected over 20 billion images. People were not informed that their images were collected by the company or how it intended to use them.
“By enabling ubiquitous public monitoring, they may facilitate systematic repression against targeted groups, encourage investigative overreach, or have a chilling effect on expression and association.
“These capacities are being tested to their limits in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), where a sophisticated infrastructure of digital authoritarianism is emerging,” the report said while identifying China as a “leading provider” of AI surveillance tools.
