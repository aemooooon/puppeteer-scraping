The report offers 34 recommendations for the government to reassess its interactions with the regime on a variety of issues, including how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exploits or interferes with Canadian institutions to advance its own interests. In particular, universities and academic institutions are susceptible to such interference in their research collaborations with Chinese institutions, which calls for proactive measures to safeguard national security and intellectual property, it said.
Evans pointed out that there are currently 140,000 foreign students from China registered at post-secondary institutions in Canada, that hundreds of student exchanges and training programs are established between Canadian and Chinese universities, and that hundreds of research collaborations are funded from a combination of Canadian and Chinese sources.
Meanwhile, the CACN report provided further recommendations surrounding security concerns in terms of academic collaborations with the Chinese regime. In particular, it urged Ottawa to explore the possibility of issuing security clearances for key individuals in the non-profit sector, private sector, universities, and research institutions, allowing them to receive comprehensive briefings from Canada’s security and intelligence agencies so that they can take appropriate steps to protect their intellectual property.
“I think [the CIs] are serving as a tool on campuses, both to control the Chinese students who are there and to spread the Chinese worldview,” she added.
