Automaker Volkswagen has announced Artificial Intelligence (AI) will soon be integrated into several of its vehicle models later this year.
ChatGPT is a chatbot, a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation, both written and spoken.
Activities such as raising the internal temperature, controlling navigation, and entertainment in the car can all be done via voice command using AI.
At this stage, ChatGPT functionality for Volkswagen cars is expected to launch in European markets in the second quarter of 2024. Approval for the United States market is pending, and a timeline for when American drivers will be able to use AI capabilities in their Volkswagen vehicles isn’t known at this stage.
Volkswagen claims it is the first volume manufacturer to make AI tech a standard feature in its compact segment cars. However, many of its competitors are experimenting with AI as well.
Europe has also taken a few steps on its path to AI regulation with the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), which aims to set clear rules for using and developing AI.
