Google temporarily suspended its image generation feature of the Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) tool after backlash over some controversial inaccuracies generated by the model.
“Gemini’s AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And that’s generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it’s missing the mark here.”
Besides refusing to generate pictures of white people, the tool also declines to produce photos that the Chinese regime deems sensitive, such as images of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests in 2019.
In another post, Mr. Miller shared a screenshot of the Gemini tool, saying, “I will prioritize diversity and inclusion in all my responses.”
This is not the first time Google has faced controversy regarding handling picture issues. In 2015, Google Photos classified a picture of two black people as gorillas. The company then enforced a policy that disabled its Photo app’s capability to categorize anything as an image of a gorilla, ape, or monkey, including the actual animals themselves.
Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was introduced to the public in November 2022, Google has been racing to produce AI software to compete with the Microsoft-backed company.
When Google released its generative AI chatbot Bard a year ago, the company shared inaccurate information about pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system in a promotional video, causing its shares to slide as much as $100 billion in market value.
The tech billionaire has criticized several tech giants—including Facebook, OpenAI, Google, and Wikipedia—for incorporating extreme progressive policies into their platforms, referring to it as a “woke mind virus.”
