President Donald Trump implied on Thursday that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus spread from the Wuhan P4 laboratory due to incompetence.
“It’s either they made a terrible mistake, probably it was incompetence, somebody was stupid, and they didn’t do the job that they should’ve done.”
He also reaffirmed that the virus originated from China.
“Whether people like to say it or not, everybody knows that,” he said.
It’s unclear how the office came to this conclusion.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), aligned with the Intelligence Community about the nature of the virus.
The IC has also committed to investigating whether the virus was leaked from the Wuhan lab.
The numbers are considered inaccurate by many because of a lag in data collection by governments as well as significant underreporting of known cases and deaths by the regime ruling mainland China.
There are over 1.2 million confirmed cases and 75,447 deaths in the United States, the data shows.
Though it remains to be seen whether the virus came from the Wuhan lab, a lack of transparency there has caused serious concerns.
“This is not the first time there has been a risk. The SARS virus when it broke out, there were leaks from their labs,” he said.
