A 6-year-old boy was apparently caught using Alexa to cheat on his homework.
New Jersey mom Yerelyn Cueva, 24, tweeted a video of her son, Jariel, who was supposed to be doing his math homework without any help. “Should I whoop him now or later,” she asked jokingly.
“Alexa, what’s 5 minus 3?” Jariel asks the machine, awaiting its response. “5 minus 3 equals 2,” Alexa responds. The video then shows Cueva going into the room to confront her son.
“What you don’t see is after he says, ‘Thank you, Alexa, for helping me with my homework,’” she added, saying the boy likes doing math but was being “lazy.”
“The funny thing is that math is actually his favorite subject,” Cueva added to the paper. “I was surprised because he knows this stuff. He was just being lazy. Taking a shortcut.”
Sanctuary worker Marion Wischnewski said she has to check her account every day to see if the parrot, an African grey, has ordered something.
“He knows the telephone and can make different mobile ringtones,” Wischnewski told the Times. “He can do the microwave or the squeaking door on my fridge. He can do the ice cream van in the summer, and a truck reversing so loud you think it’s in your living room.”
Alexa has also chatted with users about sexuality, and the device also made comments on dog excrement. And this summer, a hack Amazon traced back to China may have exposed some customers’ data, according to five people familiar with the events.
The episodes, previously unreported, arise from Amazon’s strategy to make Alexa a better communicator. New research is helping Alexa mimic human banter and talk about almost anything it finds on the internet.
