The Biden administration is taking steps to restrict China’s investment and trade to slow Beijing’s quest for dominance, but it is slow going with piecemeal and often uncoordinated legislation.
American money supports the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) juggernaut on both sides of the Pacific. China is buying up assets in the United States, while American investors and consumers are funding the CCP. Reshoring American factories can counter this because it would reduce U.S. exposure to CCP-controlled supply chains and cut off the funding the CCP needs for its global ambitions.
For this reason, the Trump administration applied restrictions to CCP soft power initiatives in America. Consequently, most of the Confucius Institutes in the United States have been shut down, and employees of CCP state media are required to register as agents.
