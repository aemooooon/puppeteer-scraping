The Biden administration on July 9 added a total of 19 Chinese entities to its economic blacklist over their role in furthering Beijing’s human rights abuses and supporting military aggression.

“The firm is dedicated to providing solutions for government agencies such as the police to protect city security,” it stated. It noted a plan to export such equipment to Islamic countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Afghanistan through the Belt and Road Initiative, the regime’s trillion-dollar global infrastructure project to expand China’s economic and political influence in Asia, Europe, and Africa.
The Friday sanction reflects an escalation in the U.S. effort to scrutinize Chinese firms’ high-tech surveillance activity in Xinjiang.
