The Procure Space ETF waits to add companies to the ETF until they have completed their SPAC mergers.
“The surge in space-related companies going public signifies that investors are ready to take the space economy seriously,” ProcureAM CEO and co-Founder Andrew Chanin said.
The Procure Space ETF launched in April 2019 and has generated more than $100 million in assets under management.
“We’re thrilled that as the space economy grows and evolves, we can continue to expand UFO’s pure-play exposure to the most cutting-edge technologies across the space sector.”
The UFO ETF is up 4 percent year-to-date and has risen 11 percent since its inception.
