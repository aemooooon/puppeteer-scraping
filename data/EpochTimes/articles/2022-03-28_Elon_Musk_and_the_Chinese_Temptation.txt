“The concerns center on the potential for China to gain access to the classified information possessed by Mr. Musk’s closely held Space Exploration Technologies Corp., including through SpaceX’s foreign suppliers that might have ties to Beijing.”
“It seems ironic, but even though you have sort of a single-party system, they really, actually seem to care a lot about the well-being of the people. In fact, they’re maybe even more sensitive to public opinion than what I see in the US.”
“I am a fan of Elon Musk and SpaceX, but anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China .... Congress doesn’t have good eyes on this.”
SpaceX is a company whose technology has military applications. Gardner’s point is that to sell to the Pentagon and NASA, SpaceX must remain compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which require weapons manufacturers to prevent their technology from being accessed by countries like China. Any leak, or forced technology transfer to China, could jeopardize SpaceX’s ITAR compliance—and with it, its relationship with U.S. government entities.
So, Musk will have some choices to make.
“Other American CEOs have close relationships to the [Chinese Communist] Party. But Musk is the only one who loudly praises Beijing while running a space company with incredibly sensitive and powerful defense applications. Can Musk continue to walk this line? A clearer separation between SpaceX and Tesla would help him manage the potential downsides of a spiraling U.S.-China relationship.”
Musk’s dilemma is not unique. The close technology-sharing relationship between Tesla and SpaceX poses national security risks to his adopted home country, but so do Google’s and Microsoft’s work with China on artificial intelligence. U.S. government policy is predictably slow in catching up to the speed of hard-charging, globe-spanning enterprises like Musk’s, and the Chinese are only too happy to increase that gap.
