Meanwhile, Baidu said second-quarter revenue fell 1 percent to 26.0 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) from the same period a year earlier but was better than an average analyst estimate of 25.7 billion yuan.
The company said it couldn’t predict the timing, outcome, or consequences of the probe and had hired professional advisers to conduct an internal review.
The SEC investigation comes at a time when Washington has threatened to delist Chinese companies that don’t meet U.S. accounting standards amid escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
Baidu CEO Robin Li said that while he expects geopolitical tensions to bring about “hiccups” for its business, prospects for its artificial intelligence division position the company as “cautiously optimistic” about the second half.
Baidu’s revenue from advertising remains under pressure as big businesses in industries such as travel and financial services continue to pull back on ad spending.
