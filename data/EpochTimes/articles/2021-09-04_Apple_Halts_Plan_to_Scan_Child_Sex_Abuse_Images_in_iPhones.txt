Apple has decided to delay its plan to scan iPhones or iPads for child sex abuse images to “protect children” after facing fierce backlash.
On Aug. 5, Apple declared an “ambitious” plan of “Expanded Protections for Children.” The Cupertino-based tech giant said it would introduce new child safety features in three areas, of which the feature to detect child sexual abuse material in iPhones and iPads is the most controversial.
The database of child sexual abuse imagery that Apple would check against is not controlled by a single entity or government, Apple added.
Apple’s plan almost immediately drew intense criticism from security experts, human rights groups, civil liberties advocates, and others over concerns it would pose threat to privacy, security, freedom, and open up doors to more government surveillance.
It’s reported that Apple had made compromises with the Chinese communist regime to keep its business in China.
Independent security experts and Apple engineers said that would make it nearly impossible to stop the Chinese regime from accessing these data.
However, Apple said it had “never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate.” Apple also said its encryption technology in China is its most advanced and has never used in other countries.
