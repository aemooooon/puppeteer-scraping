Malaysia’s Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein is contemplating a trip to China to discuss the newly minted AUKUS alliance between Australia, the United States (U.S.), and the United Kingdom (UK).
Malaysian and Indonesian authorities have raised concerns about a potential arms race in the region, which is in contrast to the Philippines government who backed the agreement.
“Our strength is not when we are alone. Our strength is when these 10 ASEAN member countries are united to see the position and security of the region be defended,” he said.
He went on to say that he had spoken with Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton in recent days and called for more dialogue with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
“This is because it has the potential to disrupt security and stability in the South-East Asia region,” Hishammuddin said. “Therefore, all parties should refrain from using any military action that can be considered provocative.”
However, at the heart of the agreement is a pledge from the U.S. and UK governments to assist the Australian government with acquiring nuclear-powered submarines.
The move is argued to significantly influence the power balance in the Indo-Pacific while elevating the potency of Australia’s naval capability, making it one of the six nations globally to operate nuclear-powered subs, despite being a non-nuclear power.
Currently, only India, the UK, the U.S., China, France, and Russia have similar capabilities.
The formation of AUKUS comes amid increasing concern over Beijing’s posturing and aggression in the Indo-Pacific region, from actions such as the takeover of Hong Kong, building artificial islands in the South China Sea, economic coercion against Australia, and an ongoing military build-up.
