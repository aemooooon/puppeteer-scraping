The United States is again warning the UK about using technology from China’s Huawei for its 5G telecommunications networks, saying it would be a threat to the country’s national security.
U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien said any move by the UK’s government that would allow Chinese telecommunications companies into a 5G network would benefit the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), by giving access to private data from British citizens or other sensitive information.
“It is somewhat shocking to us that folks in the UK would look at Huawei as some sort of a commercial decision. 5G is a national security decision,” he added.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will soon decide whether to ban Huawei from 5G networks.
O'Brien said the data gathered by the communist regime is no small thing.
“If you get all the information on a person and then you get their genome, and you marry those two things up, and you have an authoritarian state wielding that information, that is an incredible amount of power,” he told FT. “Why the UK would sign up for such a program is astonishing.”
The citizens of Europe and other allies, such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are “starting to understand that letting Huawei into their countries is like letting the Trojan horse into Troy,” O'Brien said in the interview.
He spoke about the Trump administration’s efforts to lead in emerging technologies, warning that the Chinese communist regime’s rising influence and control of technology would “not only undermine the freedoms of their own citizens but all citizens of the world.”
Much of Kratsios’s speech at a major global technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, was dedicated to urging the United States and Europe to work together in embracing technology innovation to “defend our free system against our adversaries, that seek to undermine our shared values.”
