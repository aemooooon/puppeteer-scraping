The University of Montreal (UdeM) says two 2019 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) it signed with a China-based educational institution linked to the Chinese military never moved forward to begin actual work.
“Both protocols have expired since and there has been no follow-up,” O’Meara said, noting that “the laboratory never saw the light of day and no work was begun.”
The BIT article said attendees also witnessed the joint laboratory’s inauguration by Lefebvre and Ding Gangyi, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Committee at the BIT’s School of Computer Science and Technology. Certificates were also presented to the members of the joint lab’s technical committee.
Also at the event was Yang Chunhui, an official from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the department that oversees cybersecurity for the Chinese regime.
One of the reasons for launching the joint lab was the recognition of “data as a basic national strategic resource,” given “the rapid development of technologies and application such as big data, cloud computing, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, and blockchain” in recent years, according to the BIT article.
The article said the event symbolized that the joint lab has entered the “operational stage in substance” and that it will carry out “in-depth cooperation to build a world-class data governance platform and international exchange platform through methods such as seminars, exchange visits among key members, collaborative education, and joint applications to undertake international cooperation projects.”
BIT is one of the “Seven Sons of National Defence,” a group of seven Chinese national public research universities affiliated with and funded by the MIIT, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).
