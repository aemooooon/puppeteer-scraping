If you’ve had a COVID-19 test, there’s a good possibility that the folks in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have your DNA.
The letter explained that the FBI Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate had warned Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s office of the risk that DNA samples from the COVID-19 tests that Fulgent Genetics was to provide would “likely be shared with the Republic of China.”
Why would a U.S. company wish to provide American DNA samples?
Why on Earth would China even want DNA samples from Americans?
For what purpose?
How many American DNA samples do they have already?
And most importantly, what does our DNA have to do with the FBI’s concern with weapons of mass destruction (WMD) from China?
But just being able to launch a deadly, highly targeted or even WMD bio attack isn’t enough. The survival of a nation also depends on its ability to defend against one. Like nuclear retaliation strategy (second-strike capability) is meant to deter a first strike, a nation’s biowarfare retaliation ability may be a critical factor in deterring such attacks.
