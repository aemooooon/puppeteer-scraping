Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced legislation on Jan. 11 that calls for increased transparency from the federal government regarding funds flowing to companies in China.
“We know that Communist China does its best to hide the finances of its government and businesses from Americans,” Mr. Scott said in a statement.
The legislation also tracks federal spending on federal-funded entities, including American universities’ China-based campuses.
“When it comes to countries that are our enemies, like Communist China, there needs to be complete transparency and oversight with any resources going their way—especially your tax dollars,” Mr. Scott added.
Communist China poses “a threat to our way of life and our national security,” Mr. Green said. “Xi Jinping will stop at nothing to undermine the United States.”
