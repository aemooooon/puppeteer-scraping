Professor Satoshi Omura discovered ivermectin in Japanese soil in 1975. He isolated a bacterial species, Streptomyces avermectinius, from the soil and found a new compound, avermectin, the precursor to ivermectin. He then modified avermectin into a safer and more effective drug—ivermectin.
This drug has saved hundreds of millions of people around the world suffering from two parasitic diseases that have plagued tropical regions for centuries—river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. It has also been proven effective in treating many other parasitic infections, including gastrointestinal roundworms, mites, ticks, and scabies.
When a virus enters a human cell, it is carried by a vehicle-like transporter to replicate inside the cell and spread throughout the body. Ivermectin has the ability to block the function of this transporter, thereby preventing the virus from replicating and spreading.
As a drug primarily extracted from nature, ivermectin has shown impressive versatility in its uses within the human body. Similar to other natural compounds, ivermectin has the ability to act on multiple targets simultaneously. These types of natural compounds can be thought of as a Swiss army knife, designed not for just one purpose, but with many potential uses waiting to be discovered.
Initially, ivermectin was found to have a specific target, paralyzing certain muscles in worms while having little effect on mammals.
Scientists considered using ivermectin as a potential solution, and it proved to be effective, resulting in one success after another.
It has also demonstrated efficacy in specific human studies.
These observational studies have a strict level of control and exclude the bias from confounding factors in treated and nontreated groups, presenting an advantage over randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
If a drug has treatment potential and is relatively safe, doctors should be allowed to use it off-label as long as they follow the correct human dosage.
Despite strong clinical evidence for the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 treatment, the drug has been largely underutilized and has even been banned by authorities for nonscientific reasons.
As noted at the beginning of the article, the recent settlement of the ivermectin case is a significant step in reducing the FDA’s excessive involvement in the relationship between doctors and patients. Many lives could have been saved if ivermectin and other early treatments had been made available instead of being ignored, vilified, and underutilized.
What constitutes genuine science? And what is the appropriate path to advance science and medicine?
Humans may not fully appreciate the real benefits and values of nature, including its role in preventing epidemics.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a silent war started between those pursuing cutting-edge technology and those favoring more traditional approaches.
One side pursuing advanced technology has chosen to develop vaccines, even utilizing mRNA technology despite its immaturity. This has led to unprecedented, bold, and massive experimentation in hundreds of millions of humans.
The other approach involves looking inward, improving our diet and lifestyle, balancing our immunity, and utilizing natural remedies.
This is not to say we shouldn’t develop new drugs or vaccines; it’s undoubtedly positive if they are effective. However, we should not let human arrogance, money, or politics blind us and tarnish real science.
The ultimate goal of scientific research is to benefit people—not solely to pursue advanced medical treatments.
Advanced pharmaceuticals do not always equate to superior medications, just as everyone is aware that high-tech, synthetic foods are not optimal for our health.
When Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, pioneered the systematic study of clinical medicine, he could not have envisioned this present-day scenario.
