Recruiters receive hundreds of applicants for one position. And it’s laborious to go through all the resumes. Fifty-two percent of hiring managers say finding the right candidate is difficult. The result is that artificial intelligence (AI) is used to screen applicants.
Using AI in the hiring process is varied. Some human resources (HR) recruiters use it for resumes and other document reviews, while others use it to hire and source candidates. Overall, AI streamlines and improves the recruitment process.
That’s why writing your resume for AI and humans is crucial. After all, once you pass through AI, a human will read and evaluate it.
Although it’s customary to place a name and contact information in the header and education credentials in the footer, these should be avoided. The ATS can’t read data in the header or footer.
Besides avoiding the header and footer, avoid fancy formatting. The best course of action is to keep it simple. Use a business font like Times Roman. AI can’t read complicated fonts.
Although some ATSs can recognize synonyms, most employers have exact match systems. Only use descriptions that apply to you with the exact words the job description asked for.
But don’t overuse keywords. By trying to over-optimize the resume, you could hurt yourself. AI is trained to spot this. And even if your resume does make it to a human. It could be a turn-off to a hiring manager.
Some candidates will apply to several jobs in one company. They’ll change their email address or slightly change their name.
When a human recruiter screens a resume, they only look at it for six to eight seconds. So, crafting the perfect resume for a human doesn’t always work.
