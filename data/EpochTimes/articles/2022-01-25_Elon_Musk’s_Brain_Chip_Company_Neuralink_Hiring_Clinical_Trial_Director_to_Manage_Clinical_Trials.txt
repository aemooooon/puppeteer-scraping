Elon Musk’s brain interface company Neuralink is hiring a clinical trial director in a sign that the startup is preparing to begin clinical trials in humans.
The applicant must be “mission-driven,” “able to meet tight deadlines with accuracy and efficiency,” and have an “understanding of the clinical trial process from beginning to end.”
Referred to as a “fully integrated brain-machine interface (BMI) system” or a “brain computer interface (BCI),” the technology enables a computer and other digital devices to wirelessly directly communicate with the human brain.
“Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again,” Musk said.
“We hope to have this in our first humans, which will be people that have severe spinal cord injuries like tetraplegics, quadriplegics, next year, pending FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval,” he said.
“I think we have a chance with Neuralink to restore full-body functionality to someone who has a spinal cord injury. Neuralink’s working well in monkeys, and we’re actually doing just a lot of testing and just confirming that it’s very safe and reliable and the Neuralink device can be removed safely.”
A Neuralink spokesperson didn’t respond as of press time to a request by The Epoch Times for comment.
While the United States has been making waves in the field of brain technology, concern is growing that Chinese military officials are also spending billions each year on neuroscience, in an effort to weaponize the brain.
In March 2021, a Chinese military-run newspaper described cloud-powered artificial intelligence (AI) “integrating human and machine” as the key to winning wars.
