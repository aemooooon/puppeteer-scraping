Ottawa expressed concerns that “hostile state-sponsored or state-influenced actors may try to spread disinformation and manipulate information” by leveraging foreign investments in the sector.
These include assessing the reach and audience of the product’s content, the investor’s ties to a foreign government, and potential use of the Canadian business for spreading disinformation or censoring information in a way that’s inconsistent with Canadian rights and values.
The government will also scrutinize the composition of the board of directors of the Canadian business and the degree of control or influence the investor would likely exert on the business and the content of its products.
“Net benefit reviews for foreign investments in the cultural interactive digital media sector, particularly in businesses that create their own original intellectual property, may require stricter undertakings for a longer period of time, particularly with respect to creative independence, corporate governance and transparency,” Mr. Champagne said in his statement.
While the statement didn’t pinpoint specific countries, the government has identified China, Russia, and Iran as significant threats to Canadian national security and intellectual property on numerous occasions.
