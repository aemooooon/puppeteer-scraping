Japanese investment giant SoftBank has been bracing for successive financial losses in China, not only because of China’s tighter regulations, but also because its investment business in China’s artificial intelligence technology sector has fallen into the realm of the latest U.S. ban on the Chinese military.
The U.S. Treasury Department alleges that SenseTime played a role in the CCP’s suppression of Uyghurs by developing a facial recognition program that could identify the target ethnic group, with a particular focus on identifying Uyghurs.
Wang Jun, former director of the international department of Unirule Institute of Economics based in Beijing, told The Epoch Times that it would be “very troublesome” for Chinese high-tech companies, especially those related to the military industry, to go public in the U.S. in the future.
The economic expert believes that Chinese high-tech companies will be scrutinized by U.S. regulators and will be subject to heavy restrictions on raising U.S. capital and acquiring U.S. technology. As a result, it will be difficult for Chinese companies to attract foreign investment.
By leaving the U.S. stock market, the amount of money Chinese technology companies could raise in the future will be greatly reduced. “Hong Kong is not comparable to Wall Street. Hong Kong is a financial market in the Asia-Pacific region, but Wall Street is the financial center of the world,” said Wang Jun.
“You may raise $500 million in Hong Kong, but you can raise $5 billion or $2 billion in the U.S.”
