A source that gave documents to The Intercept claimed that Shenzhen-based Semptian uses high-performance cloud computing to “enhance the capabilities of internet surveillance and censorship technology it provides to human rights-abusing security agencies in China” that routinely surveils 200 million Chinese Internet users each day.
The Intercept sources revealed that Aegis is operating in China’s phone and internet networks to censor information and assist government agents to “collect people’s email records, phone calls, text messages, cellphone locations, and web browsing histories.”
