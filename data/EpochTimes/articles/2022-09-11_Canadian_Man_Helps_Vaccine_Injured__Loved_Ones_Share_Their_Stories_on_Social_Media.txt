Most Facebook pages on the topic of vaccine side effects and adverse events get removed very quickly by the social media platform, managing to get only a few thousand followers. With technical skills and the use of methods that stay within the confines of Facebook’s terms of service, Henriques and his team managed to keep their page up much longer, getting over 245,000 followers to date.
The AI expert says the “heartbeat” of the group is those who share their stories.
“The stories that you read on there [about] vaccine injuries, vaccine deaths, they’re very visceral,” he said. “These are real people in your communities, telling you, telling everybody about their story, and I think that’s what makes it more real.”
Henriques says the page is currently moderated by about 15 to 20 moderators, who remove any trolls attempting to disparage members or be disrespectful to them.
“[It’s] kind of like Facebook, except with all the statistics from all over the world,” he said.
“I’m going to have the geographical locations, which vaccines they took, what lot number, what happened to them, all the important statistical data. We’re also going to have a section there where they can find help.”
The programming expert says he will keep the new website open source for anyone, including those from media organizations, who are interested to “see what the data is almost in real time” of people around the world injured by the vaccines.
“My mission is to have our very own platform free from censorship and judgment—a place where caring people can come share their stories free from harassment and feeling safe in a community that truly listens to them,” his fundraiser pages say.
