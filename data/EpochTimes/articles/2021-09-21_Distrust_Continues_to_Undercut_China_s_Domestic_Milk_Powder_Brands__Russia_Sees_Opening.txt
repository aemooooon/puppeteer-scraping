Chinese citizens, impacted by continuous findings of contamination in domestic brands of milk powder, hold a steady dependence on foreign brands. Russia’s Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation stated on Sept. 14 that China imported nearly a quarter of global whole milk powder exports in 2020.
And China’s demand for imported milk powder has continued to soar in 2021. China’s imports of milk powder in the first two quarters of 2021 increased by 34 percent compared to the same period in 2020, and over 90 percent of the volume was supplied from New Zealand, the Russian ministry’s report said.
The report also mentioned that, for global exports of milk powder, butter, and cheese, China imported respectively 13 percent, 9 percent, and 4 percent in 2020.
The scandal in 2008 saw many infants who consumed milk powder produced by state-owned dairy company Sanlu Group, based in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, develop kidney stones, triggering the investigations that found melamine or melanic acid in Sanlu Group’s milk powder.
With the reputation of the state-backed company in tatters, the Chinese lost their trust in domestic brands from then on.
