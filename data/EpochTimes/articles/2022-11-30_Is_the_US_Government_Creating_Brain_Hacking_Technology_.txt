The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, more commonly referred to as DARPA, is a research and development agency affiliated with the Pentagon. Its main responsibility involves creating new technologies for the U.S. military.
However, red flags begin to emerge when one delves a little deeper into DARPA’s work. Another program being run by the agency is called NEAT, an acronym for the Neural Evidence Aggregation Tool.
To think that technology capable of reading minds will be confined solely to the realms of military warfare requires a complete suspension of disbelief. As the aforementioned Hinchcliffe, a man who has been highlighting elements of government overreach for years warned, the NEAT program has “the very real potential” to give the U.S. government and various corporations with questionable agendas to hack everyday civilians at the preconscious level.
