The future of China is much greater than the digital dictatorship-driven, dystopian prison camp of a nation that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has laid so heavily upon their people over the past couple of decades.
The CCP has so much more in mind.
After all, why enslave just one-fifth of the world when you can have all of it under your boot heel?
They’re not wrong, either.
There is no leadership from the White House, only conciliation and weakness with regard to China and Iran, without any assertion of a U.S.-led world. In other words, China is filling the void on the world stage left by the departure of the Trump administration, a void that is only growing by the day under the Biden administration.
What’s more, Biden’s excessive spending (nearly $2 trillion) under the ruse of COVID-19 relief, and a pending $3 trillion infrastructure plan, will only further undermine the economy and threaten our very viability by adding unsustainable debt service to our national budget even as productivity falls and unemployment rises.
In short, the United States is now on the same retrograde, post-empire path that it was on pre-Trump, resulting in a power vacuum in the world. Given these destructive trends, why wouldn’t the regime in China seek to remake the world in its own image?
In fact, no one is.
Today, the CCP has shown its hand, and the United States, with its diminished leadership and economic profligacy, is unable, and in some cases unwilling, to push back.
What’s more, a Harris administration, which will likely be a fact in the near future, won’t make any difference. It may even expedite the transition of America into an economically hobbled nation at home and an also-ran abroad.
