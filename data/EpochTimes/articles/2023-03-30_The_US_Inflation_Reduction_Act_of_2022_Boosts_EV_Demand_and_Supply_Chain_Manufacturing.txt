President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is igniting a growing demand for new and used electric vehicles (EVs). It also incentivizes manufacturers across the entire EV supply chain with credits when they build new or retool existing facilities for EV manufacturing inside the United States.
In recent years, Foxconn has leveraged its software and hardware platforms to diversify into various industries, including electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors.
Under the agreement, Lordstown will outsource its manufacturing operations associated with the plant to Foxconn. Foxconn will continue to employ over 400 of Lordstown’s employees to produce its Endurance electric commercial pickup truck.
With the establishment of a Tesla gigafactory in Mexico, both Pegatron and Quanta expect their manufacturing businesses there to grow significantly.
In 2023 and beyond, China’s share of North America’s EV market is expected to shrink due to an uptick in EV supply-chain manufacturing investments made possible in the United States by countries willing to comply with the new IRA legislation.
For example, to receive half of the tax credit, at least 50 percent of EV battery components sold in the United States must be manufactured or assembled in the United States, or in a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement.
The legislation also states that to receive the other half of the credit, at least 40 percent of the key minerals used in EV batteries must be extracted and processed in the United States, or a country with which the United Staes has a free trade agreement, or recycled minerals from North America by 2024; this percentage will increase by 10 percent each year from 2024, to 80 percent by 2027.
