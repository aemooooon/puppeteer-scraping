Recently, the Biden administration issued new answers for Americans invested in Chinese companies with direct ties to Beijing’s military. Previously, U.S. policy was that Americans were forbidden to invest in companies included in a “blacklist” of Chinese companies directly involved in China’s military, and in producing applications used by the Communist regime to oppress its own people and threaten its neighbors.
The new “answers” amount to a wholesale abandonment of a policy Americans of all political stripes supported.
The back-pedaling might be the result of successful lobbying by American financial firms unsure whether the rules would allow them to continue to trade these stocks on behalf of their non-U.S. clients and distribute dividends from those stocks to American clients. But it can also be seen as part of a long easing of economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, without obtaining any benefit for American prestige or negotiating leverage with China in return.
The problem is, of course, that moves like this should be offered only in negotiation with the Chinese over things important to American national security, and the peace and freedom of our allies. Giving up on it because it was “confusing” to international financial institutions is a sad excuse.
And it comes at a time when the Biden administration has also announced a tariff waiver on solar panels coming from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This action, explained as a “bridge” while domestic solar panel manufacturing ramps up, reopens a previously closed door to China’s dumping solar panels into the U.S. market.
Top U.S. panel manufacturer First Solar said the administration’s move “undermines American solar manufacturing.”
At the same time, China is these days more belligerent, more aggressive, and more of a problem than ever. What exactly is the Biden administration getting for its quiet retreat from the tougher trade policies of the Trump administration?
