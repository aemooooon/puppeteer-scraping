Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a plan on Thursday to create rules for artificial intelligence (AI) to address national security and education concerns as programs like ChatGPT become increasingly popular.
The proposal would require companies to allow independent experts to review and test AI technologies ahead of public release or update and provide users with access to their findings.
Schumer, a Democrat, cited the Chinese Communist Party’s recent release of its own approach to regulating AI as a “wake-up call” to America, and urgent action is required for the United States to stay ahead of China and shape and leverage this powerful technology.
In a statement, Schumer said his proposed framework of rules “would prevent potentially catastrophic damage to our country while simultaneously making sure the U.S. advances and leads in this transformative technology.”
“Given the AI industry’s consequential and fast moving impact on society, national security, and the global economy, I’ve worked with some of the leading AI practitioners and thought leaders to create a framework that outlines a new regulatory regime that would prevent potentially catastrophic damage to our country while simultaneously making sure the U.S. advances and leads in this transformative technology,” Schumer said.
The AI program called ChatGPT has skyrocketed in popularity and caught the attention of U.S. lawmakers due to its quick ability to write answers to various types of questions. With over 100 million monthly active users, it has become the quickest-growing consumer application in history.
Shumer’s proposal has yet to be drafted into legislation and will need to gain approval from Congress and the White House, and could take several months or more.
President Joe Biden recently stated that it is still uncertain whether AI poses a threat. He expressed his belief that technology companies should ensure the safety of their products prior to their release to the public. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department has requested public input regarding potential accountability measures for AI.
The first guardrail requires companies to allow independent experts to review and test AI technologies before they are released to the public. The second guardrail involves making the results of these tests available to users.
The third guardrail requires companies to provide data to the government about their AI products, which can be used to regulate the industry and reduce potential harm. Finally, the fourth guardrail focuses on ensuring that AI systems are aligned with “American values” and deliver on their promise to create a better world.
Microsoft Corporation, which is a significant investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has been investing billions of dollars into AI, along with Google’s Alphabet Inc. These investments are aimed at gaining a competitive advantage amid growing competition in Silicon Valley.
