Huawei’s recent launch of its latest smartphone, which uses an advanced 7-nanometer chip made in China and an unidentified South Korean chip, has raised questions about whether the regime in Beijing has breached U.S. sanctions.
The Chinese telecom equipment company unveiled its Mate 60 Pro smartphone in late August as U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo wrapped up her visit to China.
The new Kirin 9000s chip used in the Mate 60 Pro is equipped with advanced 7-nanometer chips developed by Chinese company SMIC International. Although it hasn’t reached the most advanced level, the Huawei Kirin 9000s chip’s launch still raises questions about whether the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has evaded U.S. sanctions.
Huawei was put on a U.S. trade control blacklist in 2019 and on the U.S. entity list in September 2020, making it no longer able to cooperate with TSMC to produce Kirin chips.
After the Mate 60 Pro was disassembled, a smartphone-specific LPDDR5 chip and NAND flash chip made by South Korean chip giant SK Hynix also were found. It also isn’t clear how Huawei obtained the SK Hynix chips.
SK Hynix stated that after the United States imposed sanctions on Huawei, the company fully implemented the U.S. government’s export restrictions and has stopped doing business with Huawei. The company also stated that it has reported the incident to the Industrial Security Bureau under the Department of Commerce and has opened an investigation.
SIA also revealed that Huawei has received about $30 billion in support from the CCP authorities, has acquired at least two existing factories to date, and is building a third.
That means that Huawei may have circumvented the U.S. restrictions by indirectly purchasing U.S. chipmaking equipment.
