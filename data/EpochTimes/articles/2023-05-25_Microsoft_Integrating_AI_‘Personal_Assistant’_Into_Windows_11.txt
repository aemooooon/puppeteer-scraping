Microsoft is adding its centralized AI-assisted feature Copilot to Windows 11, the company announced on May 22.
Such tasks will be performed in conjunction with Bing Chat, and include summarizing or explaining content that users are viewing and providing information.
Copilot will be integrated directly into Windows 11, and “familiar and easy” to use, with customers simply opening the feature via a button in the taskbar across all apps, programs, and windows, according to Panay.
“Once open, the Windows Copilot sidebar stays consistent across your apps, programs, and windows, always available to act as your personal assistant,” Panay explained.
“It makes every user a power user, helping you take action, customize your settings and seamlessly connect across your favorite apps,” he added.
Along with summarizing content, Copilot will also answer simple and complex questions, such as the time in another time zone, and search for flights and accommodations.
They also noted that superintelligence—AI that possesses intelligence that far surpasses the brightest human minds—could become the most powerful technology that “humanity has had to contend with.”
“We can have a dramatically more prosperous future but we have to manage risk to get there. Given the possibility of existential risk, we can’t just be reactive,” Altman and other executives noted.
However, the executives said they ultimately believe that with the correct approach to advancing technology, AI could create tremendous value in the world.
Speaking at the AI Forward 2023 event in San Francisco on May 22, Gates said AI developers are currently racing to develop a personal AI agent that could perform everyday tasks for users, including reading and conducting online searches.
“Whoever wins the personal agent, that’s the big thing, because you will never go to a search site again, you will never go to a productivity site, you’ll never go to Amazon again,” Gates said.
