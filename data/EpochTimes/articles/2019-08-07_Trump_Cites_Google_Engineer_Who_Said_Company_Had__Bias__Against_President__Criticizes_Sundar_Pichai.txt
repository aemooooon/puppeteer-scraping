President Donald Trump cited a former Google engineer who said that the company was working to try to prevent Trump from being reelected.
“It all sounded good until I watched Kevin Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to ‘Make sure that Trump losses [sic] n 2020,’” he added.
Trump late Monday shared clips of Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, appearing on Fox News to speak with Lou Dobbs and told his followers, “Check out what @Google is up to for the 2020 election!”
Referencing the clips, Trump added on Tuesday: “Lou Dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the American public. @peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Ttump [sic]. All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!”
The engineer Trump referenced, Kevin Cernekee, recently appeared on Fox.
“They made every excuse in the book to avoid taking down something that made Donald Trump look bad. And I saw a number of other incidents just like that,” he added. “They thought Trump should have lost in 2016. They really want Trump to lose in 2020. That’s their agenda.”
He said he noticed during the 2016 election cycle that a Google Image search for the name of President Trump’s book, “Crippled America,” would return pictures of “Mein Kampf” instead. He tried getting the issue fixed, he added, but it took nine months.
