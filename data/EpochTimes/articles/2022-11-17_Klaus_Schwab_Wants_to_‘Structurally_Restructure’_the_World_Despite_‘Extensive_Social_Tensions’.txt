At the B20 meeting in Indonesia, Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF), put forward the proposal to restructure the world. The B20 is the official G20 dialogue forum with the international business community.
During a business restructuring, some costs will be written off and shareholders will suffer, the WEF head said. In the same way, the restructuring of an economy will result in “a reduction of disposable income which can lead to extensive social tensions,” he admitted.
Schwab also talked about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which foresees significant changes to society and industries from rising interconnectivity and automation.
During the Fourth Industrial Revolution, advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, gene editing, and so on are expected to blur the boundaries among the biological, physical, and digital worlds.
During his speech, Schwab talked about using the metaverse, a term referring to a single, universal virtual world, “to create much deeper and much more extensive and comprehensive global dialogues.” Schwab also pushed for more cooperation between the government and corporate sector.
“Governments and businesses have to cooperate in order to become a fast fish. Because in our world of today, it’s not anymore so much [about] a big fish who eats the small fish but it is a fast fish who eats the slow fish.”
“The Great Reset wants to keep you locked down … They want fewer people in the world … But they need you where they can see you,” Walsh said.
