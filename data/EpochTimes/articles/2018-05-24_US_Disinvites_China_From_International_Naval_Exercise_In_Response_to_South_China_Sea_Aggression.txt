Amidst Beijing’s ever-increasing military aggression, the United States has disinvited China from participating in an annual U.S.-led international military exercise scheduled to take place next month in the Pacific Ocean. The move is said to be in response to Beijing’s recent escalation of the militarization of islands in the South China Sea, which has been well-documented by international reports.
The “Rim of the Pacific Exercise,” known as RIMPAC, involves 27 nations and is the world’s largest international maritime warfare exercise. The annual exercise is hosted by the United States and takes place around Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet is headquartered.
“China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” said Department of Defense spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan. “As an initial response to China’s continued militarization of the South China Sea we have disinvited the PLA Navy from the 2018 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise. China’s behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the RIMPAC exercise.”
The Pentagon says it has evidence that the Chinese regime has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea. The PLA’s landing of bomber aircraft at Woody Island has also raised tensions.
Quoting ImageSat International, the Fox report says that China may be deploying HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island, although camouflage nets made it hard to confirm their presence. A HQ-9 has a range of 125 miles, and was deployed briefly on the island in 2016.
This would not be the first time the United States disinvited a foreign nation from RIMPAC to express disapproval of its behavior. Russia was disinvited in 2014 after Moscow’s incursion into Ukraine that year.
“We have called on China to remove the military systems immediately and to reverse course on the militarization of disputed South China Sea features,” the Pentagon statement says, citing the fact that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has promised the United States and the world the regime would not militarize the Spratly Islands.
“Since 2012 the PRC has made a mockery of international norms, by illegally seizing Scarborough Shoal from the Republic of the Philippines, by illegally building seven new artificial islands in the South China Sea,” said Fanell, “This decision to disinvite the PLA Navy from participating in RIMPAC 2018 sends a clear signal that the U.S. will not reward bad behavior by the PRC in the maritime domain with the privilege of participating in this premier naval exercise.”
Fanell also warned U.S. naval leadership to remain on guard as it is highly likely that Beijing will dispatch another PLA Navy intelligence collection ship to the RIMPAC exercise area just as they did in 2012 and 2014.
China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, based on the “Nine-Dash Line” that was drawn to reflect China’s interpretation of historical rights, have long been disputed by most of the neighboring countries in the region.
