Japanese messaging app Line admitted it sent user data to China, exposing people’s personal information to the communist regime.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been collecting big data—the new key asset for global power—as part of its intelligence strategy, in its bid to control worldwide information and transactions.
Chinese laws dictate that any digital information that a company holds must be turned over to the Chinese regime at its discretion.
Herman argues that if the CCP is allowed to amass data, it would have a strategic upper hand for the next century. “Add in the possibilities of quantum computing as China’s AI/ML accelerator, and we’re looking at a decisive gain for the Chinese communist regime that will be transformational not only for China but for humanity,” says Herman.
Z-Holdings officially integrated LINE in March 2021. The company also owns Yahoo! Japan.
The company apologizes and says it recognizes the importance of being cautious about handling data that travels abroad, paying attention to other countries’ local laws, as reported by The Register. LINE was also accused of lying to its users about keeping data in Japan, as some of the information is stored in South Korea. The company vowed to be more transparent.
Apart from being a messaging app, LINE also offers a payments service. The app has more than 85 million monthly users in Japan and the local government employs its digital services.
