German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned about artificial intelligence turning into a threat to democracy, calling for better digital literacy among the public to be able to identify AI-manipulated content.
While liberal democracies may identify potential dangers of AI, there are authoritarian powers that are seeing these developments in a different light, he stated. “That’s all the more reason for us to be clear in our stance.”
Steinmeier called for societies to develop legal and ethical frameworks to monitor AI. “We’ve been warned that potentially uncontrollable risks are coming our way … And that deserves our attention.”
“It’s important to recognize digital authoritarianism as a phenomenon that’s about much more than the repressive application of tech,” she said. “We have to see it as an alternative model of governance that’s spreading around the world, competing with democracy.”
Some experts worry that AI-fueled misinformation could become prevalent in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, with videos, images, and text generated via artificial intelligence used to sway and influence the public.
However, the three images showing Trump hugging and kissing Fauci were later identified as fake and AI-generated.
“AI-enabled tech will be capable of surveilling, micro-targeting, and influencing democratic populations in ways that were previously impossible through traditional state monitoring and privately-developed social media algorithms,” he said.
“AI will be able to find minimum winning coalitions in n-dimensional political space to determine short- and medium-term political goals, for example, and then influence those populations through AI content production.”
