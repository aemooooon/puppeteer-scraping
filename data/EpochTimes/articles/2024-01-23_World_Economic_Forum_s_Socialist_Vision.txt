The World Economic Forum (WEF) brings together world leaders and business tycoons to build a socialist, dystopian future for the rest of us.
Despite Mr. Schwab’s rejection of the term “elites,” it is undeniable that WEF attendees hold significant decision-making power. Many of them are heads of state or high-ranking government officials in democracies, leading to concerns among voters about the legitimacy of their representation at a globalist, invitation-only meeting. This raises questions about the authority these elected officials and civil servants—supported by taxpayers’ money—have to make decisions that may go against the preferences of those they represent.
The underlying assumption is that the WEF seeks a global solution by determining the right balance between freedoms and restrictions to combat misinformation, regardless of individual governments’ or their constituencies’ perspectives on the appropriate compromise between rights and protections.
