After the head of the Czech Senate said “I am a Taiwanese'” in a speech at Taiwan’s parliament on Tuesday, a throwback to the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy’s defiance of communism in Berlin in 1963, China slammed him for crossing a red line.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has threatened to make Czech Senate speaker Milos Vystrcil pay a “heavy price” for visiting the island. The Czech Republic, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
In his address, Vystrcil directly referenced Kennedy’s “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech and emphasized democratic freedoms embraced since the Czech Republic threw off communist rule at the end of the Cold War and Taiwan emerged from martial law at the end of the 1980s.
“In 1963, the American president JFK, in his famous speech ‘I’m a Berliner,’ clearly opposed communism and political oppression and supported the people of West Berlin,” Vystrcil said. “He said ‘Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.'”
“Please let me also express in person my support to Taiwan and the ultimate value of freedom and conclude today’s speech ... with perhaps a more humble, but equally strong statement: ‘I am a Taiwanese,’” Vystrcil said, receiving a standing ovation. He spoke the last phrase in Mandarin Chinese.
Vystrcil has said his Taiwan visit underscores the “values-based” foreign policy put in place by late President Vaclav Havel, an anti-communist dissident and personal friend of the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama.
“If he wants to visit Taiwan to designate it as an independent state, isn’t this a public affront, a public challenge? That is why we must tell and we have told the Czech Senate speaker, ‘You have crossed the red line,’” Wang said.
Maas, whose country holds the European Union’s rotating presidency, said he had been in touch with his Czech colleague about the Senate president’s visit.
“Europeans operate in foreign and security policy very closely with one another and we treat our international partners with respect, and we expect that from them as well,” Maas said. “Threats are not a part of that,” said Mass at a briefing in Berlin on Tuesday after talks with Wang.

Slovakia’s President Zuzana Čaputová said in a twitter message that Slovakia “stands by the Czech Republic. EU-China relations are based on dialogue and mutual respect. Threats directed at one of the EU members and its representatives contradict the very essence of our partnership and as such are unacceptable.”
The parliamentarians condemned the pressure exerted by the Chinese authorities on Vystrcil trying to discourage him from visiting Taiwan.
“The Czech Republic has the right to develop economic and cultural cooperation with Taiwan and President Vystrčil, constitutionally second highest representative of the Czech Republic, does not need People’s Republic of China approval for visiting Taiwan,” the parliamentarians said in the joint statement.
“We strongly reject these statements which don’t belong in relations between two sovereign countries. Although I did not support the visit as such, I will always defend the sovereignty of the Czech Republic,“ Petříček said according to Radio Prague International.
The letter threatened that Czech companies operating in mainland China, such as Volkswagen subsidiary Skoda Auto and lender Home Credit Group, as well as others, would suffer if Kubera visited Taiwan.
