U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns says American firms face multiple challenges in China, particularly the lack of intellectual property (IP) protection.
“There is still intellectual property theft from American companies here,” Mr. Burns said.
Asked whether every American company fears IP theft in China, he replied, “Yes.”
“They’ve passed an amendment to their counter-espionage law. And it’s written in such a general way that it could be that American business people could be accused of espionage for engaging in practices that are perfectly legal and acceptable everywhere else in the world,” Mr. Burns said.
“This is the most important, most competitive, and most dangerous relationship that the United States has in the world right now and will, I think, for the next decade or so,” he said.
The ambassador elaborated that the current competition is unlike the Cold War when the Soviet Union had a “very weak economy.” He added, “We’re dealing with an adversary, a competitor in China stronger than the Soviet Union was in the 1940s, ‘50s, ’60s, ‘70s, and ’80s.”
“Our idea—America’s big idea of a democratic society and human freedom—versus China’s idea that a communist state is stronger than a democracy. We don’t believe that,” Mr. Burns said. “So there’s a battle here as to whose ideas should lead the world. And we believe those are American ideas.”
New technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) are driving the current military race between the two nations, he added.
“Our companies and tech experts are competing in AI and biotech and quantum mathematics. All those technological advances will lead to a new generation of military technology,” the ambassador said.
“Our two militaries are vying for military supremacy—who’s going to be the most powerful in the most important, strategic part of the world, which is the Indo-Pacific.”
