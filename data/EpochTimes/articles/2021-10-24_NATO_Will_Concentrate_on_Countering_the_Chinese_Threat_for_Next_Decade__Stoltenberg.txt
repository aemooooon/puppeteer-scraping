This comes as the Chinese regime has become more assertive in its ambitions of global dominance, having allegedly gained the upper hand in key warfare technologies, such as long-range and hypersonic missiles.
In his interview with The Financial Times, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said China’s cyber capabilities, new technologies, and long-range missiles have already affected European security.
“This region faces global challenges: terrorism, cyber but also the rise of China. So when it comes to strengthening our collective defense, that’s also about how to address the rise of China,” he said. “What we can predict is that the rise of China will impact our security. It already has.”
NATO, a political and military alliance of North America and the European Union, will adopt a new Strategic Concept during a summit next summer. The Strategic Concept will state the organization’s direction during the next decade, which will focus on offsetting the Chinese regime’s threat, unlike the version outlined in 2010.
“They have more and more high-range weapons that can reach all NATO allied countries,” Stoltenberg told The Financial Times. “They are building many, many silos for long-range intercontinental missiles.”
In addition, the communist regime has become a cyber threat and has been gaining influence in developing countries through its Belt and Road infrastructure projects.
