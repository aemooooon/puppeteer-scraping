With economic slowdowns in Europe and Asia, what actions, if any, can we expect from the Federal Reserve?
And this seems to be the trend. That in itself should be a red flag. Fraud can often be a sign of weakness.
For example, bank executives who decide that they must defraud millions of their customers in order to hit profit or activity goals have a bigger problem than simply shoddy ethics. It’s a clear indication that their customers either can’t or won’t use their services. The question bank executives should ask themselves is, “Why is that?”
There are a few reasons for that and they don’t bode well for the economy and the markets.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, America ended up with fewer and bigger banks than before the meltdown. That means that a small group of too-big-to-fail are carrying more liabilities than they were in 2008. If even one of them mismanages their portfolio, is over-leveraged, or finds itself in deep legal problems, the impact of a single failure could have a much greater impact on the economy than in the Financial Crisis.
Shadow banking is primarily a symptom of traditional banking’s failure to meet consumer and business demands. It exists because it fills a vacuum in the market.
