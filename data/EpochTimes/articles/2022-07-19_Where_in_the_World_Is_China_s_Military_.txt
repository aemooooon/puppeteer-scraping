The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is developing infrastructure and access all around the world. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) created a unique process to get countries to agree to give the PLA access to key ports and bases via several methods, including the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
What else has the PLA been up to? This article gathers and highlights some details on PLA overseas locations.
The article will discuss three kinds of PLA forward deployments: “permanent,” “as needed,” and “in development.”
One consequence of China’s growing participation in U.N. peacekeeping missions is that each PLA deployment provides insight and access to places the CCP did not have before the deployment.
Thus, the Namibia site houses PLA personnel that support manned space flight, satellite tracking, and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches.
On May 26, an Australian Air Force P-8 aircraft flew in international airspace over the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands when the PLAAF J-16 (probably from Woody Island) intercepted it. During the intercept, the J-16 conducted dangerous maneuvers, including discharging chaff and flares that were sucked into the P-8’s jet engines, which could have caused it to crash.
