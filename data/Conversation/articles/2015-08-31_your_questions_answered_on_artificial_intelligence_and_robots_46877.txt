Forget Hollywood, the future of artificial intelligence and robotics is even more fascinating – and perhaps more worrying – than fiction.
We’ve recently seen ruminations on AI emotion, speculation about the prospects of superintelligent AI, a debate around whether lethal autonomous weapons (often dubbed “killer robots”) ought to be banned and heard that AI could even pose an existential threat to our species.
We’ve also heard that automation might gobble up jobs at an alarming rate, putting even highly skilled people out of work.
So what does the future hold for AI and robotics? Here’s your chance to find out.
Ask your questions and we’ll put them to our experts to answer. You can submit your questions below in the comments, on Facebook.com/conversationEDU or on Twitter using the #YourQuestionsAnswered hashtag.
