New “artificial intelligence” software is being developed to support decision-making by sugar mill operators.
Dr Andrew Chiou, an investigator on the project, says the proposed system will provide predictive decision support by working with current operators and sugar mill systems.
“This project aims to demonstrate the viability of the developed framework through improved sugar productivity and quality, reduction of production costs, increasing equipment utilisation and improving the decision making process undertaken by factory staff within the sugar mill crystallisation stage and fugal operational areas,” he said.
