In just a few months, higher education has moved from being afraid of how generative AI like ChatGPT could help students cheat, to cautiously embracing it by allowing students to use it under certain circumstances.
In getting to grips with how AI will change education and society, we’ve heard mainly from educators, university management and other experts. But what about students, whose studies, careers, relationships and futures will be most impacted by AI?
We are academics from universities in Sydney and Hong Kong, specialising in higher education practice and research.
Over the last two months, we have asked students their thoughts about how AI should be used in their education through questionnaires and focus groups. This includes a survey of more than 450 students in Hong Kong and pilot focus group panels with 13 Australian students.
Here are some the key themes to emerge so far from this ongoing research.
Students recognised that ChatGPT was helpful for summarising, brainstorming, explaining and suggesting. They mentioned how it made it easier to learn difficult topics in a conversational way.
As one told us:
Others mentioned it helps them learn during classes:

The more experience students had with ChatGPT, the more nuanced their views were. One student noted ChatGPT “will miss out on important points or misunderstand”.
Another went further to say that using AI improved their critical thinking:
Another student added, “I think students really need to understand that AI is not always correct”.
In the survey of more than 450 students across Hong Kong universities, 80% said they understood its limitations and potential inaccuracies.
Students talked about how AI could remove less desirable parts of work, to focus on more important thinking.
As one student put it:
Students said they wanted their teachers to teach them  “how to best use AI tools and make AI tools a common part of education, just like PowerPoint and Excel”.
This includes educating them about risks, biases and limitations so they can understand the technology they will inevitably be using.
Students agreed guidelines about “what happens if AI is used” are needed going forward. As one noted:

Students were concerned about the disadvantages that lack of access to ChatGPT would mean for some people.
Others noted AI was not necessarily free, as there were costs of accessing premium tools. Schools are also taking different approaches globally and locally, with some banning and some embracing AI. This could widen existing inequities.

      We need to change the way universities assess students, starting with these 3 things
The Australian Universities Accord discussion paper highlights AI as a significant opportunity, and challenge.
This is something we cannot ignore. And students want universities to actively engage with AI for their benefit.
They do so knowing this is a “difficult time” for their teachers.
But they are worried about their futures and they want their education to prepare them for life after study, in a world that is changing rapidly.
We need to work with students, industries, communities, and governments to figure out how we can help our students engage productively and responsibly with AI. This is urgent work as the pace of AI development accelerates and has wide-ranging impacts across society perhaps beyond its developers’ understanding.
