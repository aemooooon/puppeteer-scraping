With 1.2 million deaths in the 2020, or 23% of the total number of deaths, cancer is the second biggest killer in the European Union. 
The figure is all the more tragic given 40% of these cancers could be prevented through early detection and lifestyle change such as not smoking or regular exercise.
Research on the future of medicine offers hope, however, with significant progress forecast in the prevention and treatment of the disease in the decades to come. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), among others, is one of the significant causes for optimism.
Many recent research articles show that AI has the potential to transform healthcare by offering new ways to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of cancer across many therapeutic areas - oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology in particular- and across the value chain, from research, development, production down to marketing. Overall, patients stand to enjoy much better care.
Glancing over market figures, the growth of AI in healthcare is evident from the large number of players. Leaving aside the flourish of AI startups, 18 out of the 47 multinationals providing AI currently offer healthcare solutions. Out of these, 80% offer innovative solutions related strictly to treatment, while 20% produce efficiency-based tools to optimise resources and hone healthcare technology.
AI is set to contribute to six areas in particular:
Out of the areas outlined above, the market for AI-assisted medical diagnosis is faring particularly well. Worth $1.3 billion today, it is expected to see an annual growth rate of over 23% in the next five years to reach $3.7 billion in 2028. There is already strong demand for cloud-based medical image analysis software in particular. Fields such as mammography, CT-scans or MRIs are set to be among the first to be benefit from the technology.
In practice, however, many hospital centres are grappling with a lack of technological resources, making it difficult for them to tap into AI’s potential. Take the pathology slides on the basis of which biological anomalies are analysed: although all of them should be digitised to train AI models, the vast majority of European institutions currently lack the equipment to do so.
AI can be used at every stage of cancer care, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on high value-added tasks such as direct patient care and psychological support, critical technical decision-making, and clinical trials. This can lead to improved patient outcomes and a more efficient healthcare system.
Five areas stand in particular to benefit from the technology:
For all those exciting prospects, we will nevertheless need to overcome a set of challenges before we can enjoy the full range of benefits of AI-assisted healthcare.
For one, AI has yet to become more sophisticated from a technical viewpoint. For example, the current absence of a universal format for data health makes it tricky to clean it up and transfer it from one software or computer to the next. The vast majority of AI solutions also require to be trained by humans - and not any humans. In collaboration with healthcare professionals, engineers will need to carefully listen to the medical community’s needs and reflect them in emerging AI.
It’s no secret sociocultural and ethical questions will also need to be taken into consideration. Data protection remains a real issue for many citizens even though the European Union’s 2018 framework regulation for processing data, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has handed more power to individuals to dictate how companies handle their personal information. The EU AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate AI machines posing risks to health, human rights and safety, should also go some way in alleviating those concerns.
