JERUSALEM, Israel – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit four countries over the next several months – Australia, Singapore, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan – three of which represent first-time visits for a sitting prime minister.
"Israel's international relations are spreading in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and many other places," Netanyahu told cabinet ministers earlier this week.
The prime minister attributed Israel's growing opportunities to its strong technological and economic strength and its exceptional capabilities in security and intelligence.
"We realize that this development flows from Israel's technological and economic strength on one hand, and its security and intelligence capabilities on the other," he said.
Last July, Netanyahu visited four West African countries – Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia – in an effort to strengthen diplomatic and economic, an effort he hopes to expand to other African countries.
On that trip, Netanyahu was accompanied by 80 some Israeli business people representing more than 50 companies. Economic seminars were held in both Kenya and Ethiopia.
