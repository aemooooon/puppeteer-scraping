The Pentagon says U.S. forces killed an Islamic State operative suspected in taking part in the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.     Ali Awni al-Harzi died in an airstrike on Mosul in northern Iraq last week.
U.S. intelligence officials say he worked closely with ISIS-linked extremists in North Africa and the Middle East.     
"His death degrades ISIL's ability to integrate North African jihadists into the Syrian and Iraqi fight and removes a jihadist with long ties to international terrorism,"  Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said.     Four Americans died in the attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.
