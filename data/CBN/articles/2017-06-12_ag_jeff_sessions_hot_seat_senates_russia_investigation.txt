Attorney General Jeff Sessions is testifying in an open hearing Tuesday afternoon before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his role in the unfolding Russian investigation. CBN News is providing live web coverage of the hearing.
Sessions informed Congress that he will appear before the committee rather than send his second-in-command.
The attorney general is facing some scrutiny from both sides of the aisle after former FBI Director James Comey testified last week that Sessions had a third 'undisclosed' meeting with the Russian ambassador before the election â€“ a meeting which Comey called 'problematic.'
