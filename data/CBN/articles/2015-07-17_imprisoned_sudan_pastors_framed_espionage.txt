Two pastors are facing a death sentence in Sudan, accused of espionage.
Government officials are using information found on a laptop as evidence to convict South Sudanese pastors Yat Michael and David Yein.
The pastors have been jailed since last December (Yein) and January (Michael). Sudanese law, which abides by Sharia law, requires them to be executed if they are convicted.
Apart from internal church reports, maps, and Christian literature - officials say they also found a national intelligence and a security service study guide.
