Iran has just sentenced a Christian convert named Hossein Saketi to a year behind bars, Mohabat News reports.
Saketi was arrested in July and throughout the year was transferred to numerous Iranian prisons and courts. 
At one point he was held in solitary confinement for 15 days. During his trial he was charged with Christian evangelism.
During the past three years Iran has ramped up its persecution of Christians, shutting down churches and throwing dozens of Iranian Christians in jail for their faith.
For example, Mohabat reports that five Christian converts from a house church in Tehran were recently arrested during their Christmas celebration. 
And Iran's Ministry of Intelligence is forcing churches to ban Farsi-speaking Iranians from attending. Last week, St. Peter Church in Tehran became the latest to announce that Farsi-speaking Christians are no longer allowed.
