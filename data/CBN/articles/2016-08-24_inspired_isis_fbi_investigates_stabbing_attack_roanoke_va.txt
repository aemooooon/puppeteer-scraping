ROANOKE, Va. - The FBI is investigating a possible ISIS-inspired stabbing in Roanoke, Virginia.
Officials say a man shouting "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great) attacked a man and woman outside the Pines Apartments in Roanoke Saturday evening.  
Roanoke police say the suspect, 20-year-old Wasil Farooqui of Roanoke County, stabbed the couple and may have been trying to behead the male victim. The man was able to fight off the attacker, who fled the scene.
A U.S. intelligence source told CBS News Farooqui had been on the FBI's radar for months after flying to Europe and possibly trying to sneak into Syria earlier this year. It appears he was self-radicalized.
Farooqui was arrested at the hospital after checking himself in for injuries. He's charged with two counts of aggravated malicious wounding and is being held without bond.
