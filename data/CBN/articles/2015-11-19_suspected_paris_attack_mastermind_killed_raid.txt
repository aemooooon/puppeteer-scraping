The radical Muslim suspected of masterminding the deadly terrorist attacks in France was killed in Wednesday's police raid on an apartment building in northern Paris.
French authorities say 27-year-old Abdelhamid Abaaoud was identified based on skin samples. Authorities had hoped to find Abaaoud when they raided the apartment located in a St. Denis neighborhood. The raid ended with eight arrests and two people dead, one a woman who blew herself up with a suicide vest.  She is thought to be the cousin of Friday's ringleader.   Police sources say they are convinced the jihadists were about to launch another attack in Paris, just before the start of the busy morning commute.  Despite the Saint Denis raid, authorities are working around the clock to prevent additional attacks aimed at Paris. One intelligence source shared that French officials are still bracing themselves for another attack, as they have good reason to believe there are more ISIS sleeper cells around the country.  In a statement to French mayors, President Francois Hollande reiterated the violent nature of Wednesday's raid proves France is at war against terror. 
"There is no more ... divide. There are only men and women of duty," he said. "...We must destroy this army that menaces the entire world, not just some countries."
