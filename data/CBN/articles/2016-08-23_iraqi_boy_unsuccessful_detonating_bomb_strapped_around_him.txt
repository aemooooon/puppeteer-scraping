An Iraqi boy had a bomb strapped to his waist ready to detonate on Sunday, in the city of Kirkuk. Police were able to restrain him and cut off the belt that held the explosive on him. 
The local media surrounded the child as he was apprehended by authorities to be taken in for questioning. A police chief said the boy was carrying two kilograms of TNT (trinitrotoluene). 
The boy's arrest came an hour after a suicide bomb was unleashed on a Shia mosque in the same city, where only the bomber died and two others were wounded. 
The Islamic State said it is responsible for the mosque bombing. 
"The boy claimed during interrogation that he had been kidnapped by masked men who put the explosives on him and sent him to the area," a Kirkuk intelligence official said.
Officials also said the boy was displaced from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-held city of Mosul. According to reports, the boy's brother also detonated a bomb in a suicide mission, killing himself elsewhere in the city.
