The retired Marine Corps general picked to lead the U.S. fight against ISIS in Iraq is stepping down this fall.
Gen. John Allen is leaving over his frustration over U.S. policy in the Middle East as well to help care for his wife who suffers from an auto-immune disease, sources told Fox News.
Allen, who has held the post for a year, has been unhappy with the aministration's policy for much of that time. He's stayed six months longer than he planned and will leave the position in early November.
The news comes amid mounting evidence that the war against ISIS is not going as well as the administration likes to admit.
Earlier this month, Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that a program to train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS has produced only four or five fighters on the front lines.
The revelation comes after two senior analysts in the Defense Intelligence Angency sent a letter to the Pentagon's Inspector General claiming that intelligence reports are being altered to present a better picture than really exists.
The Daily Beast reported that some 50 analysts are backing up the letter.
