A Paris judged has charged three women with terrorism. Authorities believe they are part of a female commando unit of ISIS who were allegedly planning a deadly terror attack in France.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins spoke to reporters after the women were arrested.
"In the last few days and hours a terrorist cell was dismantled, composed of young women totally receptive to the deadly Daesh (ISIS) ideology," Molins said, calling ISIS by its Arabic acronym.
The girls were involved in the stabbing of a police officer. One of the women was betrothed to one of the Islamic terrorists who slit the throat of a French priest in July.
They were also linked to an abandoned car full of explosives near the Notre Dame Cathedral. But the terror attack was foiled and the women were carried away as they screamed "Allahu Akbar," or "Allah is great."
"There's a group that has been annihilated, but there are others," French President Francois Hollande said Friday. "Information we were able to get from our intelligence services allowed us to act before it was too late."
