North Korea is developing missiles that could carry tactical nuclear warheads, South Korea intelligence sources told the Korean newspaper Joongang Daily.
A government official told the paper that intelligence officials came to that conclusion after examining missile tests in North Korea last month.
"We've come to the conclusion that the rockets test-fired three times since last month are new missiles based on their speeds and altitudes," a senior South Korean government official was quoted as saying.
"Based on our analysis and other intelligence, we concluded that they are intended to carry tactical nuclear weapons," he added.
