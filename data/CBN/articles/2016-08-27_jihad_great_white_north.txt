Dangerous radical Muslim teaching has become commonplace in many Canadian mosques and Islamic Centers. 
A new monograph entitled "The Lovers of Death?" by former Canadian intelligence analyst Thomas Quiggin and journalist Saied Shoaaib claims radical jihadist literature made up the majority of books found in libraries in many mosques and Islamic schools in Canada. 
The authors found the works of Sayyid Qutb, an islamic radical who has inspired terrorists, and Ibn Wahhab, founder of the extremist Wahabbi sect of Islam. 
The Daily Caller reports the Canadian Council of Imams has rejected the report's findings, claiming that Muslim leaders in Canada consistently denounce Islamic radicalism.
