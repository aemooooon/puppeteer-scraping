JERUSALEM, Israel â€“ Israeli airstrikes targeted a weapons convoy and Syrian military posts outside Damascus and along the Lebanese border overnight Wednesday, Arab media reported.
It's not the first time Israel has taken out weapons convoys traveling unimpeded through Syria en route to Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon. Israel has vowed not to allow weapons to reach Hezbollah, now well entrenched in the Lebanese government.
An Israeli spokesman declined comment on the airstrikes, reminding the press it does not respond to foreign media reports.
Lebanese media reported the strikes targeted Syrian military outposts, including weapons warehouses, around 3:00 a.m. Wednesday.
The latest airstrikes follow provocative comments by Hezbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah and Lebanese President Michel Aoun.
In an interview on Iranian television last week, Nasrallah warned Israel to "think a million times" before declaring war on Lebanon, warning that its long-range missiles could reach Israel's nuclear reactor in Dimona in the south and its ammonia storage facility in the northern port city of Haifa.
Meanwhile, the Lebanese president called Hezbollah's weapons cache "an essential part of defending the country."
Israeli Minister of Intelligence Yisrael Katz responded to Nasrallah's threats by saying all of Lebanon will be in the crosshairs should Hezbollah attack Israel.
