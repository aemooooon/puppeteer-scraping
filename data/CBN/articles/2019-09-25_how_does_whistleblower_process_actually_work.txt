WASHINGTON – The White House is working to provide Congress with the report from the whistleblower who kicked off a new impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, targeting President Trump for his phone call with the Ukrainian president. 
The Trump administration is trying to de-classify the report so they can hand it to Congress, hoping it will help prove the president's innocence. But how does the whistleblower process actually work?
In this case, involving President Trump, once the DNI realized the complaint was about the president, he sought guidance from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which advised him the complaint about the president's communications with a foreign leader was covered by executive privilege. Within the executive branch, OLC opinions are considered to be binding.
