WASHINGTON â€“ House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is speaking out on what he expects to hear from President Donald Trump during his first address to a joint session of Congress.
"We expect him to deliver a bold, optimistic message to the American people," the Wisconsin lawmaker told reporters at a press conference Tuesday.
Ryan added that he predicts the president will strike a tone of unity and renewal.
"Tonight has particular importance. What I think the president recognizes, what we all recognize is that this is a once in a generation moment, once in a generation opportunity. We have the opportunity to tackle big problems that have held us back for so long," said Ryan.
Trump's top priorities include replacing Obamacare and a tax overhaul.
"We can fix our healthcare system so that costs go down and choices go up. We can fix our broken tax code so that rates go down and growth goes up," said Ryan.
