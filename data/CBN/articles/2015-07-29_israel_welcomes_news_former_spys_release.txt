JERUSALEM, Israel -- Israel welcomed Tuesday's long-awaited announcement to release Israeli agent Jonathan Pollard after serving 30 years of a life sentence, including a number of years in solitary confinement.
Pollard was convicted of passing U.S. intelligence information to Israel.
Successive U.S. presidents refused to grant Pollard clemency despite his failing health and numerous appeals by respected leaders, such as former U.S. secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George P. Schultz and former CIA Director James Woolsey, among others.
In 2013, Pollard's handler, former MK Rafi Eitan, asked his forgiveness for the many years behind bars, saying Pollard had served more time than anyone else for similar offenses. He is, in fact, the sole person in U.S. history to be incarcerated for so many years for spying for a friendly state. 
Some observers, noted the timing of the release announcement coming on the heels of the Iranian nuclear deal, which has further strained Israeli-U.S. relations. But others, including Secretary of State John Kerry, say the two events are unrelated.
According to the U.S. Parole Commission's announcement, Pollard will be released on November 20. His lawyers appealed to President Barack Obama to allow him to return to Israel immediately.
"President Obama, who has the constitutional power of executive clemency, has the authority to release Mr. Pollard before November 21, 2015, as well as the authority to allow Mr. Pollard to leave the United States and move to Israel immediately," their letter stated. "We respectfully urge the president to exercise his clemency power in this manner."
Following the announcement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Pollard's wife, Esther, his release finally comes "after decades of efforts."
Netanyahu told her he "consistently raised the issue of his release in my meetings and conversations with successive U.S. administrations. We are looking forward to his release."
