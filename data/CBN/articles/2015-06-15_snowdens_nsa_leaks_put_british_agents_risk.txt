Britain claims revelations by NSA leaker Edward Snowden has put their intelligence agents at risk.
The government has pulled several of its operatives from the field for their protection.
Security officials say China and Russia used Snowden's information to learn more about their intelligence gathering techniques and possibly even ways to identify spies.
"We never comment on operational intelligence matters so I'm not going to talk about what we have or haven't done in order to mitigate the effect of the Snowden revelations," British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. "But nobody should be in any doubt that Edward Snowden has caused immense damage."
