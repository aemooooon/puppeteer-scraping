In another black eye for the CIA, sources tell CBN News a former CIA officer was charged Tuesday with unlawful possession of classified records – and he is suspected of the worst crime for any agent: betraying the United States and giving secrets to China.
The former officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 53, was arrested Monday after flying to New York from his home in Hong Kong, federal authorities announced.
According to federal sources, Lee is facing one count of unlawfully possessing national defense information, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
He was found to be holding two notebooks containing the true names of CIA assets and covert facilities.
Sources say he could be responsible for causing the deaths of approximately 20 American agents in one of the worst intelligence breaches in decades.
Meanwhile, Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, refrained from commenting on the case Tuesday, citing Lee's ongoing prosecution.
