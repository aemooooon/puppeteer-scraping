JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel's Defense Force struck multiple Hamas targets Sunday after violent riots erupted on the Gazan border. 
An IDF soldier was wounded by an improvised explosive thrown by Palestinian rioters east of the city of Jabaliya around 9:00 p.m. The soldier sustained wounds to the neck and is in moderate condition as Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical center. 
"An IDF soldier was injured apparently by an explosive device that was thrown at him," the army said.
Israeli soldiers responded to the border clash by open firing on Palestinian terrorists along the border. A spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry reported that 19 Palestinians were wounded. 
Palestinian media reports that the rioters were trying to break into Israel through the security fence but were driven back by IDF gunfire. During the riot, Palestinians burned tires and threw makeshift explosives at Israeli soldiers. 
IDF tanks also hit two Hamas observation posts near the border. 
Sunday night's violent clash comes just two days after another massive border riot in which another IDF service member was lightly wounded by a pipe bomb. 
An Israeli Military Intelligence assessment released last Wednesday said that Hamas may try to provoke a war with Israel to gain an influx of international aid to the Gaza strip.  
Palestinian rioters have repeatedly clashed with IDF soldiers since last March.
