Democratic presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton says she won't apologize for her controversial email practices while she was secretary of state.
Clinton has been criticized for sending classified information while using a personal email server for government business.
During a Labor Day campaign stop in Iowa, Clinton told the Associated Press, "What I did was allowed." 
Clinton also said she doesn't think the lingering questions about her email practices will damage her presidential campaign.
But she has been falling in the polls in recent days, behind her fellow Democratic presidential contender, socialist Bernie Sanders.
Last year, Clinton deleted thousands of the emails from her private email server, declaring them personal. But she turned over roughly 55,000 emails related to her government service to the State Department.
