The Senate Armed Services Committee will meet Thursday morning for a hearing on "foreign cyber threats to the United States," centering their conversation on one big player in security: Russia. 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been at odds with President-elect Donald Trump and blames Russia for the hacks during the election. 
"If you try to destroy the fundamentals of democracy, then you have destroyed a nation," McCain said. 
"And by the way, there are various gradients of acts of war. I'm not saying it's an atomic attack. I'm just saying that when you attack a nation's fundamental structure, which they are doing, then it's an act of war," he added. 
Trump denies there is any proof of Russia's involvement. 
 
 
U.S. intelligence and Homeland Security officials said in October that the computer hackings were from "Russia's senior-most officials," to interfere with the election. 
Meanwhile, some lawmakers still have questions about how the Russian government transferred stolen emails to WikiLeaks, where they were published during the last days of the campaign. 
"I don't believe they interfered," Trump said in an interview with Time Magazine.
