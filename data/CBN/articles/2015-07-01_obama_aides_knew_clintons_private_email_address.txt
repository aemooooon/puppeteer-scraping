Senior Obama administration officials knew back in 2009 that Hillary Clinton was using a private email account while secretary of state.
According to a new batch of emails from the State Department, even the White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel knew.
Top Obama strategist David Axelrod was also aware of her private email address, but said today, "I did not know that she used it exclusively or that she had her server in her home."
It's not clear when officials found out Clinton was running her official emails through a private email server in her Chappaqua, New York, home - a potential security risk and violation of administration policy.
The State Department released 3,000 pages of Clinton's emails late Tuesday night.
They show Clinton sent or received at least a dozen messages in 2009 on her private server that were later classified as "confidential" because they contained sensitive intelligence information.
At least two-dozen emails were also marked "sensitive but unclassified" at the time they were written.
Though Clinton has said her home system included "numerous safeguards," it's not clear if it used encryption software to protect her communications from the prying eyes of foreign spies or hackers.
Clinton's emails have become an issue in her early 2016 presidential campaign, as Republicans accuse her of using a private account rather than the standard government address to avoid public scrutiny of her correspondence.
As the controversy has continued, Clinton has seen ratings of her character and trustworthiness drop in polling.
Clinton turned some of her emails over to the State Department last year, nearly two years after leaving the Obama administration.
