The big news out of "Trump World" Friday is the fact that President-elect Trump met with intelligence community leaders. After it, he released a statement acknowledging, for the first time, that Russia indeed tried to break into America's cyber infrastructure including the Democrat National Committee.
However, in typical Trump fashion, he had a caveat saying, "There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful." Trump says he'll appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days to combat cyber attacks.
