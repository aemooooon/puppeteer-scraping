Several thousand Iranians set U.S. flags on fire and chanted anti-American slogans on Wednesday, marking the 36th anniversary of the 1979 student takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. 
Fifty-two American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days after the U.S. refused to return toppled Iranian shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Iran for trial.
On the eve of the anniversary, Iran's state television announced that a Lebanese-American, Nazar Zaka, had been arrested on suspicion of "deep ties with the U.S. military and intelligence services," the report cited.
The U.S. State Department said Zaka is not an American citizen.
"We are aware of reports that a U.S. lawful permanent resident has been arrested in Iran," State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said. "U.S. lawful permanent residents are not U.S. passport holders and would travel on the passport of their nationality. Consular assistance would be provided by the country of the individual's nationality."
Four other Iranian-Americans are being held in Tehran, including Pastor Saeed Abedini, who was convicted in 2013 on Christian-related activities.
Protesters on Wednesday chanted "Death to America," "God damn America," and "No compromise, no surrender to U.S." as they urged Iran's chief nuclear negotiator not to "trust the Americans."
Hard-liners in Iran are trying to scuttle President Hassan Rouhani's outreach to the West following July's landmark nuclear deal. Opponents of the deal in Iran are deeply suspicious of the United States and its allies.
