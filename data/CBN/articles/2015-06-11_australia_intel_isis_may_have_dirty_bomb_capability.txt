The Islamic State may now have the ability to build a so-called "dirty" bomb, according to Australian intelligence.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Islamic terrorists took radioactive materials from research centers and hospitals in Syria and Iraq.
ISIS has declared plans to develop weapons of mass destruction in its online magazine. And the London Daily Mail is reporting that ISIS says it could buy a nuclear device from corrupt officials in Pakistan.
ISIS could then possibly smuggle a nuclear weapon into the United States.
For now, some experts fear ISIS will ramp up its terror campaign with the start of Ramadan next week.They're also concerned about plans for violence to mark its one-year anniversary as a caliphate on June 29.
As the United States moves to contain ISIS, the president has announced he'll send several hundred extra military advisors to Iraq. The goal is to help Iraqi fighters take back the strategic city of Ramadi.
Despite ongoing criticism that the president's strategy isn't working, the White House said it's making the right moves.
"The president and his team are confident that, for now, 450 troops, additional military personnel, are what is necessary to fulfill this expanded advise and assist training mission," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
Critics say these kind of comments indicate a policy failure.
