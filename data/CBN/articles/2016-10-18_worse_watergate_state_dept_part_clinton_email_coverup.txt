Much trouble is brewing for both presidential candidates just one day before the final presidential debate.
Republican candidate Donald Trump is still playing defense regarding his attitudes toward women. Meanwhile, new evidence shows the State Department tried to cover up a Benghazi-related message on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's private server during the FBI investigation into her email scandal.
According to FBI records released Monday, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy, a Clinton ally, offered the intelligence agency a "quid pro quo" to change the email's classification so that it wouldn't be seen.
The FBI eventually said no. Both the intelligence agency and the State Department deny there was any deal.
The political fallout? Republicans say the Obama administration was working to protect Clinton.
"This is worse than Watergate," Trump charged. "What's going on with this? And what's she get out of it? She gets to run for the presidency of the United States. Explain that. Explain that."
Meanwhile, Trump's wife, Melania, is speaking out about the videotape from 2005 in which the GOP nominee made lewd remarks about women. She told CNN that her husband is not that kind of man.
"That was kind of boy talk and he was really egged on from the host to say dirty and bad stuff," she said.
Meanwhile, there are new charges of bias against the mainstream media. It turns out that the overwhelming majority of donations from journalists have gone to Clinton.
According to the Center for Public Integrity, federal campaign finance filings show working media professionals have given $382,000 to Clinton, while they gave just $14,000 to Trump.
A new WikiLeaks release also confirms concerns about media collusion with the Democratic Party.
Politico White House political correspondent Glen Thrush emailed Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta, asking him to review a story before it was published.
"Please don't share or tell anyone I did this," Thrush said in the email.
