Voters say President Barack Obama has no real plan of action in Syria, while they call Russia's President Vladimir Putin "strong and shrewd," according to a new Fox News poll.
Those opinions come after Russia's decisive action in Syria.
Following two weeks of air and missile strikes in Syria, a Russian Defense Ministry official says its combat jets destroyed militant facilities near Aleppo, where explosives for suicide bombers were being made.
The New York Times reports that such actions show that Putin has upgraded and modernized Russia's military much more than Western intelligence and military officials had realized.
The paper says Putin is showcasing his ability to conduct operations beyond his country's borders, with a public demonstration of new weapons, tactics and strategy.
And Russia isn't only flexing its muscle with advanced hardware. The country has deployed field kitchens and even dancers and singers to entertain the troops. Some American analysts say it's a sign Moscow is in this for the long haul.
Meanwhile, Russia's growing push to prop up Syria's government is raising new scrutiny and questions about the CIA's secret support of Syrian rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad and just how far it will go to take on Putin's allies. And it seems the United States won't go very far.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday "countering Russia's involvement in Syria doesn't rate nearly as high on the scale" as battling ISIS.
U.S. voters are weighing in on the actions of Russian and U.S. leaders. The latest Fox News poll shows 53 percent think Putin has the upper hand in Syria. Only 22 percent disagree.
