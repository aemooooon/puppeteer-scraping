ISIS is employing scientists and weapons experts to train jihadis to carry out sophisticated attacks in Europe.
Sky News obtained exclusive access to one of the Islamic State's labs in the Syrian city of Raqqa.
There, in a type of "Jihadi Technical College," scientists are working on modifying weapons systems capable of targeting passenger jets and military aircraft.
That includes a homemade thermal battery for surface-to-air missiles, something thought to be a nearly impossible feat without military infrastructure.
ISIS techies have also produced fully working remote controlled cars to act as mobile bombs.
