Republicans say President Barack Obama's weak policy against ISIS played a role in what now looks to be a terror attack on the Russian plane that crashed in the Sinai.
Investigators say they're "90 percent sure" the noise heard in the final seconds of a cockpit recording was an explosion cause by a bomb, Reuters reported. 
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the crash, which killed all 224 passengers and crew onboard.
Both Democrats and Republicans say Obama needs to strengthen U.S. attacks against ISIS. And Republicans are blaming the president's ineffectual strategy for allowing the jihadist army to spread death and destruction across the Middle East and allowing Russia and Iran to take the lead in the fight.
"The sad fact is because we've had a failed policy and failed leadership, now we're having to rely on Russians and the Iranians to go into Syria to fight and destroy ISIS," Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, told "Fox News Sunday." "And that's kind of where we are today. I think Â… it's this weakness invites aggression."
Congressman Peter King, R-N.Y., says the U.S. needs boots on the ground to fight ISIS.
"This has to be an all-out effort," King said. "I don't think the president has done enough as far as having the forces on the ground [in Syria] that are necessary to make the air attacks more effective."
And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warns the U.S. cannot avoid a war with ISIS. 
"We will fight them now or we will fight them later." she told NBC News.
Feinstein says she's very worried about repeated attempts to bomb American passenger planes and believes the U.S. must do more than just the roughly 50 Special Forces members now operating in Syria.
