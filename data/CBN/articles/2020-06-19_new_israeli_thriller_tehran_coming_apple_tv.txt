JERUSALEM, Israel - Apple TV+ has bought the rights to an Israeli thriller called Tehran set in the Islamic republic’s capital.
Tehran follows the story of a Tamar Rabinayan, a talented young hacker in Israel’s intelligence community. Rabinayan, played by Israeli actress Niv Sultan, is sent by Mossad on a clandestine operation in Iran, where she is ordered to hack into an Iranian nuclear reactor.
One of the show’s creators is Moshe Zonder, a writer for Fauda, one of Israel’s biggest shows on Netflix.
 “Tehran aims to shed new light on the Israeli-Iranian conflict, and take on universal struggles around immigration, identity and patriotism to examine whether it is possible to become free from these restraints,” Zonder told Deadline last year.
The show is set for release in Israel on June 22. A US release date has not been announced. Those who live outside of Israel can watch the show using a VPN.
