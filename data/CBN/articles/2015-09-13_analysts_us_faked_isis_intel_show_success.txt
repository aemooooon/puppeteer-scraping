There are charges that U.S. intelligence reports about ISIS and al Qaeda in Syria are being altered to present a false picture of success, according to an exclusive story by The Daily Beast.
The Daily Beast says the Pentagon's inspector general is investigating claims by two senior analysts that high-level intelligence officials are changing their reports.
The analysts charge that important information has been deleted from reports, making them inaccurate.
The Daily Beast cites sources who say at least 50 spies are backing those claims.
Many of them believe the reports are being changed to support the Obama administration's line that extremist Islamic groups are on the defensive.
