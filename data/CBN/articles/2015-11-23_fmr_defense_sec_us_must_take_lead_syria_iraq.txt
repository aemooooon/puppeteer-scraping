Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta says the United States has be the leader in the fight against in Syria and Iraq.
"I think the U.S. has to lead in this effort because what we've learned a long time ago is that if the United States does not lead, nobody else will," Panetta told "Meet the Press."
He added that "air strikes alone are not going to win here."
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said President Barack Obama's move to send in 50 Special Forces to Syria isn't enough.
