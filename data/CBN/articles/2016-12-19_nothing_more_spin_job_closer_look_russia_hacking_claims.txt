Left wing activists hope protests and threats prevent a Donald Trump victory in the upcoming Electoral College vote, while Democrats and the media continue to chip away at the legitimacy of Trump's victory with stories about Russian hacking.
Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus calls it a "spin job."
"I think the real question is why the Democrats and why these electors and why MoveOn.org and all of these organizations are doing everything they can to de-legitimize the outcome of the election," he told "Fox News Sunday."
FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper reportedly agree with a CIA assessment that Russia tried to help Trump  win the White House. But there's no proof that it actually helped the president-elect win.
The source of the hacked Democratic emails, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, insists the emails did not come from Moscow.
The Washington Times reports the source was a "disgusted Democratic whistleblower."
Meanwhile, Russia wasn't the only international flap over the weekend.
Not even president yet, Trump was handed a bit of foreign policy drama when China seized a U.S. underwater drone. China has said it would give it back, but Trump tweeted, "We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back. Let them keep it!"
All this comes as the president-elect is giving new signs that he's planning a conservative domestic agenda.
Trump said Saturday he would nominate Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., as budget director.  Mulvaney has been called an anti-establishment radical on Capitol Hill. He's a strong fiscal conservative who has pushed for big cuts in government spending.
Meanwhile, at Trump's final public rally before the Electoral College vote, the Rev. Franklin Graham asked God to heal "the divide that we have in this country."
