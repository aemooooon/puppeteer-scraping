JERUSALEM, Israel Â– In a joint sting operation by the Shin Bet and Israel Police, security forces arrested five members of the Suleiman clan from Nazareth on suspicion of developing ties with ISIS.
The five men, ranging in age from 18 to 27, purchased weapons and trained for attacks against Israelis over the past year while being imbued with the Islamic State's jihadist ideology, the Shin Bet said in a statement released on Tuesday. 
"It emerged that in the past year the youths obtained firearms and trained with them, while becoming more devout during meetings they held," the Shin Bet said in a statement. "They expressed support for ISIS and praised the jihad ["holy" war] against infidels."
Based on a 2014 decision by Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon declaring the Islamic State an illegal organization, Israel Police filed indictments in the Northern District Court, charging the five with possession of illegal weapons, supporting an illegal organization and participating in illegal gatherings.
