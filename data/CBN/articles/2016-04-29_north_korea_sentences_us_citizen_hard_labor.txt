Kim Dong Chul, a U.S citizen, was charged in North Korea for engaging in spying and stealing state secrets.
He was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in a North Korean prison after a short trial in Pyongyang.
Speaking before the North Korean media last month, he 'confessed' to spying for South Korean intelligence agencies to try to overthrow the North Korean leadership. However, South Korea's National Intelligence Service has said Kim was not connected to the organization. 
Some foreigners who have been detained by North Korea have later said their guilty statements were coerced.
