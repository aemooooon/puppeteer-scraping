Hillary Clinton discussed classified information in emails sent from her private server while she was Secretary of State.     The Inspector General for the Intelligence Community told CBS News that after reviewing 40 emails, investigators found four that contained classified information and two that should have been labeled 'top secret.'   Earlier this week, Clinton agreed to turn the server over to the FBI after months of criticism.     The Clinton campaign says it's cooperating with the investigation, but the server was blank.    An attorney for the IT company that oversees the Clinton's computer systems says the drive was wiped clean when their system was upgraged.     Political analyst Larry Sabato said Clinton watchers have seen this pattern before.
