CIA Director John Brennan says the intelligence agency will not obey a waterboarding order from the next president of the United States.
"I will not agree to carry out some of these tactics and techniques I've heard bandied about because this institution needs to endure," Brennan told NBC News on Sunday. "Absolutely, I would not agree to having any CIA officer carrying out waterboarding again."
Brennan's comments come after Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, suggested they would lift the waterboarding ban.
Trump has even said he would bring back waterboarding and "worse" tactics if he is elected.
