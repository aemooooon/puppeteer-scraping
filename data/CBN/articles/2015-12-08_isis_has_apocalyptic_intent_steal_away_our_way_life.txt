Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has interrogated hundreds of Taliban, al Qaeda, and other terrorist operatives in his former role as President Barack Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
"You talk to these individuals and they have a deeply rooted belief in Sharia law," Flynn told CBN News. "These are true believers, this is not a criminal organization, this is not a cult. This is an organization that has a deeply held religious belief and it is apocalyptic ... this enemy has the willingness and intent to steal away our way of life."
Flynn said President Obama's televised address from the Oval Office Sunday night failed to present a clear strategy of how the terrorist threat will be defeated.
"I really want to cheer for our president on one hand but I just don't see the level of confidence or the level of clarity in anything he has said over the last year," Flynn said during an appearance on Monday's 700 Club.
Before joining the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn served as Director of Intelligence for the Joint Special Operations Command, a shadowy arm of the government that tracked and eliminated terrorists around the world.
The same unit was responsible for the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
After watching the Obama's speech, the third the presidenbt has delivered from the Oval Office, Flynn said he was left with "a lot of more questions."
"What the people of this country want to hear is that they want to hear the truth, and the truth is that we are facing a very cancerous radical form of a religion that needs to come to grips with itself," he said.
