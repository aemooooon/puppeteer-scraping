Trump is fighting back after Clinton told a weekly New York newspaper, The Record-Review, that Trump "doesn't know much." He went on to say, "One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him."
Clinton also told the newspaper that the president-elect called him after he won the election.
Trump fired back via his favorite medium, tweeting: "Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much..."
Trump continued in a separate tweet, "especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states (and more). They focused on the wrong states."
Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rejecting calls for a special Senate investigative committee to look into Russia's possible interference in the presidential election.
McConnell says findings by U.S. intelligence officials that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee in an effort to help Trump get elected is very serious, but he maintains that a special committee isn't needed. Instead, he wants the existing Senate Intelligence Committee to handle it.
The president-elect is spending the week at his Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, but continuing to work towards building his administration.
Today, he's meeting with Jovita Carranza who is under consideration to be his U.S. trade representative. Carranza served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under President George W. Bush. She also served as a member of Trump's Hispanic advisory council during the campaign.
Trump is also meeting with businessman Luis Quinonez who is being considered for Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Â
