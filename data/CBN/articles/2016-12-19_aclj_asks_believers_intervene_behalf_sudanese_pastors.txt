Two Sudanese Christian pastors are facing the death penalty for their faith and the American Center for Law and Justice is asking for believers to intervene before it's too late.  
Rev. Hassan Abduraheem and Rev. Kuwa Shamal are facing false charges brought against them by the Islamic security forces in Sudan, according to the ACLJ's website. 
"The lives of Rev. Shamal and Abduraheem hang in the balance," reads the website. "Both men are facing the death penalty if they are convicted. They have been charged as co-offenders under Sudan's Penal Code of 1991, with charges ranging from waging war against the state and espionage to agitating hatred between classes."
In November of 2015, the pair were arrested by Sudan's National Intelligence Security Service (NISS) after helping an injured man, who was beaten for attending a demonstration. 
The pastors asked for assistance from a church congregation to help pay for the man's medical treatment. 
However, the Sudanese government claimed that anyone who provided humanitarian aid to this individual would be committing a national security crime.
Rev. Kuwa and Rev. Hassan were arrested shortly after. 
ACLJ Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow argues that the pastor's imprisonment is directly linked to their Christian faith. He warns that if believers don't speak up the two could be hanged. 
"Christian Pastors Hassan and Kuwa need your voice now. Time is of the essence, as the trial continues. Our silence could be their death," he said. 
"Other Christians facing death in Sudan are now free because you spoke out. Be heard now for these persecuted Christians," he added.
