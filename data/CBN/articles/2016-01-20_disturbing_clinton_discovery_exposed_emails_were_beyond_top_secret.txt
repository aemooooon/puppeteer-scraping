An inspector general investigating Hillary Clinton's email scandal revealed a disturbing new discovery.
Charles McCullough, an inspector general for the intelligence community, says dozens of new emails with classified information have now been found on Clinton's private email server.
McCullough informed Congress that some of those emails included information beyond the "Top Secret" classification.
The emails included material about "Special Access Programs," classified above "Top Secret." SAP programs are highly sensitive in part because they could reveal intelligence sources.
"These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined...to be at the confidential, secret and top secret/SAP levels," according to a letter McCullough sent Congress, which was also obtained by The Associated Press.
Federal investigators have been probing Clinton's decision to use a private email server instead of a protected government email system, which could have exposed critical classified information to hackers from foreign governments.
In October, a congressional document revealed Clinton's private email server was subject to hack attempts originating in China, Germany, and South Korea.
