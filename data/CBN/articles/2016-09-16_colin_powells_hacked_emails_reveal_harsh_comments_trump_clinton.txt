Hackers have released private emails from former Secretary of State Colin Powell in which he talks bluntly about presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, among others.
The emails were posted on DCLeaks.com under password protection. Security experts told Bloomberg News the website looks like it has ties to Russian intelligence.
"We have confirmed that the general has been hacked and that these are his emails," Powell spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino told The Washington Post. "We have no other comment at this time."
The Hill reports that in a June email to a former aide, Powell called Trump a "national disgrace" and said he was "in the process of destroying himself."
According to The Hill, the emails also show Powell was upset with Clinton over how she managed personal email when she was secretary of state.
"Well, their email ploy this week didn't work and she once again looks shifty if not a liar," Powell wrote in an August email with the subject line "HRC."
"I won't be saying anything about her very soon," he also wrote, saying Clinton used private email before she and Powell shared opinions on the topic.
"I have been warning her staff for a year not to try to use me," he continued.
Powell also references in the emails former Vice President Dick Cheney, former President Bill Clinton, and the Benghazi attacks.
