JERUSALEM, Israel – Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Thursday signed a defense agreement with his Bahraini counterpart during is his first official visit to the country since Israel and Bahrain normalized ties through the Abraham Accords.
The new Memorandum of Understanding will support "any future cooperation in the areas of intelligence, mil-to-mil, industrial collaboration and more," according to Israel's Defense Ministry. 
Gantz said the visit brought the relationship between Israel and Bahrain to "new heights."
"We are building on the groundbreaking Abraham Accords and deepening ties between our nations. Only one year following the signing of the Accords, we have achieved an important defense agreement, which will contribute to the security of both countries and the stability of the region," Gantz said in a statement. 
Bahrain is one of four Arab countries to normalize ties with Israel through the US-brokered Abraham Accords. Since then, the two countries have opened embassies, established direct flights and signed several agreements.
Bahrain, like Israel, considers Iran to be an enemy and a major threat in the region. Bahrain has accused Iran of arming militant groups and stirring up division, which Iran denies.
Earlier this week, Israeli President Isaac Herzog made his first official state visit to the United Arab Emirates, which marked another step forward in Israel’s relationship with the Emiratis since the Abraham Accords.
