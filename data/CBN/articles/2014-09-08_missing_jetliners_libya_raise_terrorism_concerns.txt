Islamist militias in Libya are believed to have taken nearly a dozen commercial aircraft, and Western intelligence analysts are concerned that the jetliners could be used in terrorist attacks in the coming weeks and months.
The Washington Free Beacon reports that intelligence information on the stolen aircraft has circulated within the U.S. government in the past two weeks.
Concerns have been raised that some of the jets could be used in attacks commemorating the 13th anniversary 9/11, as well as the anniversary of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens.
"There are a number of commercial airliners that are missing," one official noted. "We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes."
At least one State Department official sought to minimize the reports, according to the Free Beacon, while another refused comment.
The aircraft theft reportedly occurred in late August at the Tripoli International Airport. The airport and several aircraft sustained damage in factional fighting in July.
Word of the stolen aircraft comes as Egypt prepares to launch what may be a military intervention in Libya to try to prevent the country from becoming a terrorist-ruled al Qaeda haven.
