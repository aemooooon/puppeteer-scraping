A 25-year-old woman has been charged with leaking a classified report with top-secret information into the investigation on Russian interference in last year's election.
Reality Leigh Winner of Augusta, Georgia, was a contractor for the National Security Agency.
She's the first person charged in a case involving leaks under President Trump, and it shows that the government will be going after the leakers.
The website "The Intercept" reported Monday it had obtained an NSA document that said Russian hackers attacked at least one U.S. voting software supplier in the run-up to last year's election.
The story also said the NSA report didn't indicate that voting machines or votes had been compromised.
The Department of Homeland Security "assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying."
    
The classified National Security Agency report does not say whether the hacking had any effect on election results.
