What needs to be done to stop the funneling of finances to terrorists through organized crime in Latin America?
That was the question lawmakers on Capitol Hill took aim at Wednesday during a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing.
Vice Chairman Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-N.C., was among those questioning a panel of expert witnesses.

Mariano Federici, president of Argentina's Financial Intelligence Unit, said he appreciated the support already provided by the United States, but said his country needs more technical assistance to beef up the fight against money laundering.
"We also need technology," Federici said. "Unfortunately, over the past 10 years, there has been little investment in technological resources, and this really affects our capacity to conduct sophisticated analysis."
"And I think that's where the United States can help us come closer to providers and companies that can offer solutions to our current challenges," he said.
In April, a congressional delegation traveled to Colombia, Panama, Paraguay and Argentina to investigate terrorism financing and the growing connection between terrorist organizations and Latin American drug lords.
"I would like to see the presence of U.S. officials more often coming to Argentina, helping us convey the right message in Buenos Aires, in the tri-border area, and I hope to be able to team up in partnership with our Brazilian and Paraguayan counterparts in those efforts as well," Federici said.
According to a news release, one of Pittenger's main discoveries was that U.S. allies in Latin America want to stop terrorist financing, but they often do not have the technology and expertise to properly respond to the intelligence they encounter.
Pittenger asked Federici to speak at the fourth Parliamentary-Intelligence Security Forum in Vienna later in June. Â
