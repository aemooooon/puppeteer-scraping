A bill giving the families of Sept. 11 victims the right to sue the government of Saudi Arabia is moving forward despite pressure from the Saudis and resistance from the Obama administration.
Â 
The Senate passed the bill, also known as Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, on Tuesday and now it moves on to the House.
The legislation, sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., allows families to sue the Saudi government in U.S. courts for any role it may have played in the terror attacks.
Passage of the bill sends the message that the United States "will combat terrorism with every tool we have available, and that the victims of terrorist attacks in our country should have every means at their disposal to seek justice," Cornyn said.
Classified intelligence material allegedly discusses possible Saudi involvement in the attacks. Relatives of the victims are urging the Obama administration to declassify the information and release it to U.S intelligence.
Saudi leaders have threatened to pull billions of dollars from the U.S. economy if the bill passes.
