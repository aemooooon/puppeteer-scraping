Washington â€“ White House officials say they have new material found by the National Security Council which they plan to share with the Heads of the Congressional Intelligence Committees investigating Russia's alleged meddling the 2016 election. Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that a letter was sent to lawmakers Thursday.
"The National Security Committee has come upon some materials they want to share with them. It's up to them to make a decision about the relevance of those documents and what they lead them to believe. There is two issues here, what did they see? And what do they want to see in addition to that?" said Spicer.
House Speaker Paul Ryan says House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes told him that it was a "whistleblower type person" who gave him the new information pertaining to Russia's role in the 2016 election. Democrats still want Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Rep. Adam Chiff says he intends to review the documents the White House is providing and does not know if the documents offered up are the same ones Nunes reviewed during a visit to the White House grounds last week.
The White House refused to say whether it gave Nunes access to highly classified materials. Spicer would not say whether the House & Senate intelligence leaders will view the same material Nunes has already seen.
