A high-stakes summit took place between the dictator of North Korea and the authoritarian leader of Russia on Wednesday.
Kim Jong Un met with Vladimir Putin in the Russian city of Vladivostok with the two rulers offering to support each other in their standoffs with the West
Kim rarely leaves his country, and he still stayed somewhat close to home, only traveling to Russia's far east which is close to North Korea. He and Putin toured a Russian space rocket launch site together.
Western intelligence believes Putin wanted to meet with Kim because he's looking to procure North Korean weapons and ammunition for his ongoing war in Ukraine.
The North Korean dictator pledged his "full and unconditional" support for what he called Russia's "sacred fight" against Ukraine.
