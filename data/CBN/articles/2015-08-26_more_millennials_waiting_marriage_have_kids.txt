A new survey shows that the number of babies born to unmarried Millenials is decreasing.
Millennials are the demographic born between the early 1980s and early 2000s.
The August edition of the U.S. Fertility Forecast by Demographic Intelligence, predicts the coming wave of Millenial mothers will "typically have a ring on their finger and a strong expectation that a hands-on parent and partner will be in their family future."
In the past, most babies born to Millenials have been outside of marriage, but that is changing according to research.
"Older and better-educated, Millennial women are moving toward family formation, and these women expect to enter parenthood after marriage," said Sam Sturgeon, president of Demographic Intelligence.
