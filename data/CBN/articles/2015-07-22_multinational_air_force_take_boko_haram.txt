The president of Nigeria says a multinational African air force will be in place within 10 days to take on the radical Islamic group Boko Haram.
The terror group has killed thousands and was behind the abduction of more than 230 Nigerian school girls from their boarding school in Chibok, many of them Christians.
President Muhammadu Buhari told the Associated Press Boko Haram will be defeated in a year and a half or less.
He admits, however, that Nigerian authorities have no intelligence information about the kidnapped girls. There were reports that many were sold to Islamic groups as sex slaves and some may have been used as suicide bombers.
