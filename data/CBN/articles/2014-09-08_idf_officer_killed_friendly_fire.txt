JERUSALEM, Israel -- Tragedy occurred early Tuesday morning when a soldier opened fire on an officer he mistook for a terrorist. 
The incident occurred around 2:00 a.m. when Capt. Tal Nahman, 21, commander of an intelligence unit, was retrieving an item from an external storage area on one of the unit's vehicles. 
Infantry soldiers on foot patrol searching for bombs near the security fence with northern Gaza reportedly attempted to identify him atop the vehicle. A soldier suspecting he was a terrorist opened fire. 
Nahman died of his wounds en route to the hospital. He will be buried in the military cemetery in his home in Nes Ziona, a city in the center of the country.
