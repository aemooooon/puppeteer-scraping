British Prime Minister David Cameron is pledging to rush through measures that will allow officials to gather mobile and Internet data.
The announcement comes in response to an April ruling by the European Court of Justice that said keeping data records violates the people's right to privacy.
Cameron argued that having the ability to intercept communication is essential to fighting terrorism and crime.
"As events in Iraq and Syria demonstrate, now is not the time to be scaling back on our ability to keep our people safe," he said.
Cameron's office noted that unless companies had a business reason to keep data and materials, they would start deleting it which would hinder investigations.
