President Barack Obama's top lawyer is investigating how the name of the CIA's top official in Afghanistan was accidentally leaked.
The officer's name was sent out in an email to thousands of journalists Saturday during Obama's surprise Memorial Day visit to the war-torn country. The name was on a list of people who met with the president.
Administration officials caught the error when a Washington Post reporter forwarded the list the to the White House "press pool."
At the request of the Obama administration, the Post and other news organizations kept the name private.
Although intentional disclosure of the name of a "covered" operative is a crime under the U.S. Intelligence Identities Protection Act, attorney Jesselyn Radack said it's unlikely anyone will be prosecuted.
Radack represented John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer sentenced to prison for disclosing to a reporter the name of an undercover agency officer.
