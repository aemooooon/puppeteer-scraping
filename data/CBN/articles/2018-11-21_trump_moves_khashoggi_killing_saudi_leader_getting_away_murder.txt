Senators on both sides of the aisle want the president to tell them who he believes is responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Republican Sen. Bob Corker and Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to the president Tuesday night. 
This came after the president said the US 'might never know' who ordered the killing and won't impose any more sanctions on the country or its leaders.    
Trump called it a "horrible crime ... that our country does not condone." But he said there's no way of ever knowing for sure if Saudi Arabia's leader was directly involved. "It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event," the president said. "Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"
The president insisted Saudi Arabia is an important regional and economic ally, and he didn't want to damage that relationship.
"Because it's America first to me. Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof," Trump said.
He also pointed out that Saudi Arabia is a key "counterbalance" for keeping the "terrorist nation" of Iran in check. "If we abandon Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake."
But Republican Sen. Rand Paul (KY) said the Trump administration shouldn't even compare Iran and Saudi Arabia. "It's a sign of weakness not to stand up to Saudi Arabia," Paul said. "Sometimes when you have two evils, maybe you don't support either side."
US intelligence officials have said they believe the Saudi crown prince was involved in Khashoggi's killing. The president said the crown prince and the Saudi king strongly deny it.
