WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump says he won't be attending the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner this spring.
In a tweet on Saturday, the president doesn't give a reason but says he wishes "everyone well and have a great evening!"
The annual fundraiser for college scholarships mixes politicians, journalists and celebrities and is typically attended by the president and first lady.
Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with news media. In recent weeks, he has accused some news outlets of publishing "fake news."
Trump has also slammed reporters for using anonymous sources. His frustration includes reports describing contacts between his campaign advisers and Russian intelligence agents, which the White House has disputed. Yet members of his staff regularly demand anonymity when talking to reporters
In a statement following Trump's tweet, WHCA President Jeff Mason says the organization "looks forward to having its annual dinner on April 29." Noting Trump's Twitter announcement, Mason calls the dinner "a celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic."
