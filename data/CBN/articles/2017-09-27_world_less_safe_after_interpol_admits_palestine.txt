JERUSALEM, Israel – The United Nations has rejected warnings from the U.S. and Israel and voted to include the Palestinians in "Interpol"...the international police agency.
 
The vote came Wednesday at a U.N. General Assembly meeting in Beijing, a day after Palestinians praised a terrorist who killed three Israelis. The vote passed 75 to 24, with 34 abstentions.
Both Washington and Jerusalem are concerned the move could put key intelligence in the wrong hands and that the Palestinians could use Interpol to pursue criminal charges against Israelis.
 
The U.S. has also argued that "Palestine" should not join Interpol because it is not a state.
Palestinian Authority officials welcomed the vote.
"The overwhelming vote in favor of Palestine's membership is a reflection of the confidence in Palestine's ability to enforce the law and commit to the organization's basic values," P.A. Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki was quoted as saying in a statement.
"Such an acceptance sends a clear message to the Israeli government that we are not population centers at its mercy; we believe in a system that is based on the global rule of law and due process and one which enforces accountability and cooperation at the international level," PLO Executive Committee member Dr. Hanan Ashrawi said.
But Israeli government minister Michael Oren condemned the decision.
"By admitting 'Palestine,' which praises terrorists of the past and refuses to condemn those of today, Interpol makes the world less safe," Oren tweeted.
Dr. Emmanuel Navon, from Tel Aviv University tweeted that admitting Palestine to Interpol was like "admitting (the famous gangster) Al Capone to the Chicago Police Department."
