The United States is helping Yemen fight al Qaeda jihadists in the Arabian Peninsula by providing military support, intelligence, ships and special operations forces.
Al Qaeda (AQAP) became a larger regional and international threat during the chaos of the 2014 Yemeni civil war, but is losing ground.
So far, the U.S military has helped Yemeni, Emirati, and Arab Coalition forces retake the port city of Mukalla from al Qaeda's control.
"Trained and supported by an Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Yemeni government forces and resistance fighters have retaken Mukalla and continue their offensive against AQAP in eastern Yemen," Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said.
"AQAP remains a significant security threat to the United States and to our regional partners and we welcome this effort to specifically remove AQAP from Mukalla and to degrade, disrupt and destroy AQAP in Yemen," he added.
Davis says the United States is providing "limited support" that includes planning, airborne surveillance, intelligence gathering, medical support, refueling and maritime interdiction.
Security officials say al Qaeda jihadists are also fleeing the coastal cities of Zinjibar and Jaar.
