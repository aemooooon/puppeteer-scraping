JERUSALEM, Israel – Syrian media says Israel’s air force attacked Hezbollah terror targets in southern and central Syria overnight.
The SANA state media news organization reports that an Israeli jet was spotted launching airstrikes “from over Lebanese airspace” and from the Golan Heights. The agency claimed that all the missiles were intercepted. Syrian state media routinely claims that it thwarts Israeli airstrikes.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the airstrikes targeted two military airports in Homs province and two areas in the Quneitra province where Hezbollah allies are located.

The IDF rarely comments on such reports, but it has previously admitted to carrying out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq to stop Iranian entrenchment there. The IDF did not claim responsibility for Wednesday’s operation.
The airstrikes come after the IDF prevented an attempted sniper attack along the Syrian border on Monday as Israelis voted in an unprecedented third election.
“IDF forces identified an attempted sniper attack in the northern Golan Heights and acted to thwart it, striking the vehicle involved in the attempt,” the military said.
Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said last month that Israel will continue attacking Iranian interests “until we achieve our final goal: expelling Iran out of Syria.”
He claimed that Israel is using a new strategy against the Islamic Republic.
“When the tentacles of the octopus strike you do not fight only against the tentacles, but suffocate its head. Likewise with Iran,” Bennett said.
