New evidence is emerging that the United States paid what appears to be a $400 million ransom for three American detainees.
Details from a new Wall Street Journal report depict a tightly scripted exchange. An Iranian cargo plane in Geneva, Switzerland, loaded with the equivalent of $400 million in cash is allowed to depart only after a flight with three freed Americans aboard takes off from Tehran.
President Barack Obama claims the payment was the first installment in a settlement reached with Iran to resolve a failed 1979 arms deal. However, the connection to the Americans' releases has lawmakers and administration critics questioning if it was actually a ransom payment.
"It's time for the Obama White House to drop the charade...President Obama has foolishly put a price on the head of every American abroad and it should be no surprise that Iran has detained more U.S. citizens," said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus in a statement.
Claims from one of the freed American hostages support the idea that the White House paid for their release.
Pastor Saeed Abedini said in an interview that they were kept waiting at an Iranian airport for more than 20 hours. A senior Iranian intelligence official explained that their departure was contingent on the movement of a second plane.
The WSJ reports that the State Department denies Abedini's claims.
