New revelations indciate the cyberattack on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management has ripped a gaping hole in U.S. espionage defenses.
The hackers, allegedly from China, are believed to have stolen the information of millions of former and current federal employees and contractors.
Congressional leaders expressed their outrage in a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday.
Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, called the cyberattack "the most devastating...in our nation's history."
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., agreed, saying it's far more serious to national security than the September 11, 2001 attacks.
The stolen information can help foreign intelligence agencies track employees with special skills or diverse backgrounds.
Private information can also be used as leverage against federal workers and put relatives and friends who live overseas at risk.
