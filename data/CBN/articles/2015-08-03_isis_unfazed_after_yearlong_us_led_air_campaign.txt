The year-long U.S.-led air campaign against ISIS has not weakened the jihadi army, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
After spending billions and allegedly killing 10,000 jihadi fighters, the Islamic State is no weaker than it was a year ago, the Associated Press quoted unnamed CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency and other sources.
That's because ISIS has been able to replenish its ranks with foreign fighters.
One defense official said the group's total strength remains between 20,000 and 30,000, about the same as it was in August 2014.
"We've seen no meaningful degradation in their numbers," he said.
ISIS has even branched out to other countries, including Libya, Afghanistan, and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
While U.S. military leaders on the ground don't dispute the assessment, they say the battle to retake Ramadi, captured by ISIS in May, is key to changing the stalemate. 
Meanwhile, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Kevin J. Killea, part of U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, told Pentagon officials the campaign has put ISIS on the defensive.
