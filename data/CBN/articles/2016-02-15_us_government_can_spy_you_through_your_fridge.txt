The U.S. government may have another way of spying on possible suspects, or just about anyone at all for that matter.
The method involves getting information out of any device or appliance connected to the Internet.
Here's how it works. These days anything can be connected to the Internet -- from cars to televisions to household appliances, like refrigerators, to cell phones and more.
It's called "the Internet of things."
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate last week that the government could hack into the Internet of things and get all kinds of information.
That means your refrigerator could be watching you in the future.
