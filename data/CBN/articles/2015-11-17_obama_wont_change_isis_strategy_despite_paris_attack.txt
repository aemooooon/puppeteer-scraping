President Barack Obama called the terror attacks on Paris a "terrible and sickening setback" in the fight against the Islamic State.
Yet, he's making it clear the United States will not change its strategy or even expand it's military campaign against ISIS.
The Islamic State released a new video today warning Washington, D.C., would face similar attacks to those in Paris.
Despite new concerns among Americans, Obama forcefully defended the vast majority of Muslims at press conference at the G20 Summit today.
"ISIL does not represent Islam. It is not representative in any way to the attitudes of the overwhelming majority of Muslims," he said. "To the degree that anyone would equate the terrible acts in Paris to the views of Islam, those kinds of stereotypes are counterproductive, they're wrong."
After the attacks in Paris, concerns are growing about the Syrian refugees about to be admitted to the United States. In fact, an increasing number of states are refusing to accept the refugees.
Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush suggests only Christian refugees facing slaughter by ISIS should be let into the country. Other candidates say the United States shouldn't accept any refugees from the Middle East, citing national security concerns.
Obama called those suggestions "shameful" and un-American.  "When I hear folks say well maybe we should admit just the Christians and not the Muslims; when I hear political leaders suggesting there would be a religious test for which person who is fleeing from a war torn country is admittedthat's shameful. That's not American. That's not who we are," he said.
