The Kurdish military force that's fighting ISIS in northern Iraq needs more help from the United States and the West. 
The Peshmerga is "puzzled" by the fact that the U.S. is not sending more assistance to help them fight the radical Islamic army, according to CBN News contributor Chuck Holton.
In a phone interview from northern Iraq, Holton told CBN news the Peshmerga are courageous, disciplined and tough fighters who are ready to do battle with ISIS, but they need more supplies and weapons. 
Further, they are reduced to being "spectators" to the U.S. air war against ISIS because they have no connections with the U.S. military to provide intelligence as to the location and military value of targets on the ground.
Holton also visited a refugee camp near Mount Sinjar, where thousands of Yazidis are preparing for another difficult winter. The Kurds have opened their arms to hundreds of thousands of victims who fled ISIS and are helping care for them, along with assistance from the international community.
