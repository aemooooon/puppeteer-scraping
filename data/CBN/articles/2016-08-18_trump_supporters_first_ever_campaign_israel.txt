For the first time ever, a U.S. presidential candidate is campaigning among Americans living in Israel. Trump supporters have launched a website, a Facebook page and now a twitter feed in Hebrew.  They also plan to set up information stands in malls around the country, reports said.
Hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens are eligible to vote in U.S. elections.  
 
According to reports, Republicans estimate that 85 percent of Americans living here will vote for trump.  
 
Typically, Americans living in Israel tend to be more religious and therefore politically conservative.
In related news, American war veteran and intelligence specialist Pete Hegseth – in Israel on a fact-finding tour -- told journalists that undermining US-Israeli relations would be tantamount to undermining the foundation of freedom in the world.
"I come here as an individual, as a veteran, as an American who is very invested in the future of our country, the future of Israel and the future of the free world," Hegseth said.
