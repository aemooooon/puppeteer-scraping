The U.S. Senate has passed a bill designating Israel as a "major strategic partner."  The bill (S-2673) would improve Israel's trade status by speeding up export licensing, and it enhances cooperation on a number of military, energy and water issues.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives almost unanimously passed a similar bill in March (HR-938) but action in the Democrat-controlled Senate had been delayed since May.
One issue important to Israelis not finalized in the Senate bill is inclusion of Israel in the Visa Waiver Program.  The program would allow Israelis to travel to the U.S. without obtaining a visa, which involves paperwork and costs more than 100 dollars.  Americans do not have to obtain a visa to visit Israel.
The Senate bill had bi-partisan sponsorship, authored by Senator Roy Blunt (R)-Missouri and Senator Barbara Boxer (D)-California.  Lawmakers approved the legislation by voice vote.
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) hailed the vote, which upgrades Israel's current status as a "major non-NATO ally."
"By declaring in legislation that Israel is a 'major strategic partner' of the United States, the bill lays the foundation for expanded U.S.-Israel cooperation in a wide variety of spheres, including intelligence, homeland security, cyber security, energy, water, agriculture, and alternative fuel technologies, AIPAC said in a statement.  "AIPAC" urges the Senate and House to move quickly to reconcile the two versions of the legislation and send it to the President for his signature."
