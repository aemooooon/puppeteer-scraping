JERUSALEM, Israel â€“ On the first anniversary of the U.S.-led Iranian nuclear deal, a German Intelligence group reports that Iran continued its pursuit of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons technology even as it negotiated.
According to the report, Iran pursued German companies to purchase equipment that could be used "for atomic, biological and chemical weapons in a war," The Jerusalem Post reported.
The report cited a FoxNews.com report on Iran's pursuit of nuclear technology and equipment from German companies, saying about half of Germany's 16 states knew what Iran was up to.
Both German and U.S. government officials claim Iran's pursuit of material and technology to produce nonconventional weapons took place before the deal was signed.
But one U.S. senator wasn't buying it.
Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., said Thursday he had "strongly opposed the flawed nuclear deal because Iran would keep cheating, as shown by Iran's numerous ballistic missile tests aimed at threatening Israel and now by the German intelligence report on Iran's aggressive efforts to secretly buy nuclear and missile technology."
