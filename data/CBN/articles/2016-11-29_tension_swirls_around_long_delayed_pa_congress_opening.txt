JERUSALEM, Israel – Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas convened the Fatah faction's seventh congress in Ramallah Tuesday.
 
The congress, which may last beyond the planned five days, was supposed to be held two years ago, but internal disputes, mainly between Abbas and exiled Fatah official Mohammed Dahlan, was cancelled.
 
Dr. Kobi Michael, former head of the Palestinian Desk at Israel's Strategic Affairs Ministry and a 23-year veteran of IDF Intelligence, told journalists, "It's almost an historical day," one that may represent the P.A. chairman's "swan song."
 
"There's a lot of tension," Michael said. "Many members who should have attended the conference will not attend. They are Dahlan supporters."
