President Donald Trump said today that North Korea should "get their act together" or it will be in trouble "like few nations have ever been."
It's just the latest salvo in an escalating war of words between the United States and North Korea.
Speaking with Vice-President Pence at his side, Trump said he might not have been "tough enough" when he warned North Korea would face "fire and fury" if it continued to threaten the U.S.
The president promised "things will happen to them like they never thought possible" if a North Korean missile strikes the U.S. or its protected territory.
Trump's comments come after North Korea, led by dictator Kim Jong Un, said the country would finalize plans for missile launches near Guam by the middle of this month and then wait for a green light from Kim before carrying them out.
"The Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA  [Notes:Korean People's Army]  will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi  [Notes:Kochi]  Prefectures of Japan," state news agency KCNA quoted army chief Gen. Kim Rak Gyom. "They will fly 3,356.7km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30-40km away from Guam."
The Hwasong missiles are North Korea's domestically produced medium and long-range weapons.
Gyom's statement, issued Thursday night, comes amid an increasingly tense tit-for-tat dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington.
The announcement comes after U.S. intelligence determined that North Korea can now put nuclear warheads onto its ballistic missiles, including an ICBM thought to be capable of reaching the United States.
