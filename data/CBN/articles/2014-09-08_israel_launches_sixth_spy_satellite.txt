JERUSALEM, Israel -- Israel successfully launched its sixth spy satellite into orbit Wednesday evening, nearly two years after the last launch. 
The satellite further enhances Israel's ability to keep closer tabs on Iran's nuclear program and other pertinent, security-related information.
A Shavit missile carried Ofek 10 into orbit from the Palmachim Air Force Base south of Tel Aviv under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense and Israel Aircraft Industries. The satellite is set for routine tests to ensure all its systems are functioning properly.
Orbiting the Earth in about an hour and a half, Ofek 10 is Israel's second spy satellite equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which enables it to take high-resolution images of objects as small as 18 inches, night or day and in all weather conditions. 
"The launch is further testimony of Israel's phenomenal capabilities in technology," Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said. "The Ofek 10 satellite will great enhance Israel's intelligence capabilities and help us to better defend the country from threats near and far, at all times of the day and night and in all types of weather."
