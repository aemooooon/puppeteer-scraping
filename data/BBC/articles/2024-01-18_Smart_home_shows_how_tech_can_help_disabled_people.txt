A old caretaker's house has been turned into a smart home showcasing assistive technology.
The property on Leechmere Industrial Estate in Sunderland demonstrates technology aimed at improving the lives of people with disabilities.
The show home was developed by Sunderland City Council and features among other things a refillable dog bowl and an artificial intelligence vacuum cleaner.
Councillor Kelly Chequer said it was an important tool in making sure "nobody is left behind".
Most of the technology in the smart home is based on existing high street technology and includes Alexa-driven gadgets.
Technology on show includes curtains that can be opened using a smart speaker and a stair lift. 
The house will be used by occupational therapists and technologists as a place to try out new ideas and train teams on how to use assistive technology.
It was developed by Sunderland City Council's adult services team and Sunderland Care and Support.
Linsey Proud, occupational therapy team manager, said: “The technology is ever-developing and it’s been amazing watching the house go from a shell to a place where we can demonstrate what is available for our customers in a real home environment that doesn’t feel clinical.
“It was important from the outset that the home was as real as possible, that it was just like a normal home and uses technology that we can easily get hold of.”
