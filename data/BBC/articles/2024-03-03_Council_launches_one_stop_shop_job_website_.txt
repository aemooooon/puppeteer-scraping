A new website for job hunters, students and residents thinking of changing careers has been launched by Cornwall Council.
Cornwall Opportunities features a searchable database of hundreds of jobs, apprenticeships and courses across a wide range of industries.
The aim of the site is to boost the economy and make it easier for residents to access information about opportunities.
Cornwall Councillor Louis Gardner said the site would help residents at a time "when the nature of skills and employment is constantly changing".
Cornwall Opportunities was developed by the council following a £257,000 grant from the Government’s G7 Legacy Fund.
The council said the site includes useful information and tools for young people, adults, employers, teachers, parents and local learning providers. 
It showcases vocational career pathways as well as raising awareness of local industries and highlighting in-demand skills and occupations, now and in the future. 
Mr Gardner, portfolio holder for economy, said the site covers a range of subjects. 
 "Whether that’s the gig economy, flexible working, net zero, automation, artificial intelligence or opportunities in our growth and emerging industries."
He added the site would "support our local employers in raising the profile of their industries, recruit to their future needs and upskill their workforce".  
Cornwall Opportunities includes a dedicated Youth Hub, an Employer Hub and a hub for people with special educational needs.
The council said the project supports two of its key priority outcomes.
The first is to make Cornwall a brilliant place to be a child and grow up and the secondly is to create a thriving, sustainable Cornwall.
