"What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?" asks Regina Dugan, then director of Darpa, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In this breathtaking talk she describes some of the extraordinary projects - a robotic humming bird, a prosthetic arm controlled by thought, and, well, the internet - that her agency has created by not worrying that they might fail. (Followed by a Q&A with TED's Chris Anderson)
