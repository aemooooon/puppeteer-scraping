More than a third of workers in the Channel Islands often find their workloads unmanageable, according to a survey by a global accountancy firm.
The research by PriceWaterhouseCooper Channel Islands found the number of employees feeling strained at work was 14% higher than workers elsewhere.
However, the survey also found that staff were less likely to leave their current job in the next 12 months.
More than 500 workers from the Channel Islands took part in the survey.
Those figures were then compared with the result of the wider PwC network's global survey which was published mid-summer.

Leyla Yildirim, from PwC Channel Islands, said workers appeared "to be committing to their current employers for the foreseeable future".

"The need to have a compelling employee value proposition to keep hold of good staff and invest in their wellbeing to grow our economy has never been more important."
