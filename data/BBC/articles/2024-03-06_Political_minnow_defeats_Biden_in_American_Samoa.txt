Joe Biden has suffered his first defeat from an unlikely quarter as he cruises towards the Democratic nomination. 
His party's voters in the US territory of American Samoa chose Jason Palmer, a Baltimore businessman who campaigned virtually and made investing in education his top issue.
He beat the president by 51 votes to 40 and they win three delegates each.
But it was a political hiccup on a night when Mr Biden swept more than a dozen US states across the board.
The president has racked up victories in every contest since Democratic voters began picking the party's nominee for the presidential election.
As the serving president seeking a second term, Mr Biden has been largely unopposed and will almost certainly face Republican Donald Trump in November.
The surprise result in American Samoa sent Mr Palmer's campaign website crashing amid a flood of search traffic from curious internet users who had never heard of him.
Speaking shortly after the local party announced the results, the 52-year-old told the BBC that Mr Biden should pass the torch to the next generation.
"We're not going to win by just saying don't vote for Trump. Americans need a positive optimistic vision of the future. And that's what I'm offering."
He campaigned on the islands virtually and by using a grassroots team. In one video posted on YouTube he said he had dedicated his career to improving education and he promised to invest in the young islanders.
A Biden campaign spokesperson dismissed the outcome, telling ABC News on Tuesday night: "There are unique politics on the island."
It is not the first time Mr Biden has lost American Samoa. In 2020, billionaire investor Michael Bloomberg won the US territory, his sole victory during that primary season. 
Despite his victory in American Samoa, Mr Palmer resides 7,000 miles (11,200km) away in Baltimore, Maryland. 
Mr Palmer's campaign website describes him as an investor with an MBA from Harvard Business School who has served in leadership positions at organisations including Microsoft and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
