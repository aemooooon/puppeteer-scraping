A university has been given £15m for a training centre aimed at developing artificial intelligence to tackle climate change.
The government funding was awarded to the University of Southampton in the hope of training at least 70 PhD students.
They will learn to use an AI technology that works on sustainability, called SustAI, the university said.
It was also awarded £31m in June towards developing trustworthy AI.
Associate Professor Dr Lindsay-Marie Armstrong said: "Sustainability is at the heart of the centre, both in its research and ethos. 
"We will equip our students with the ability to transform academic research and make a real change to businesses and society."
Professor Enrico Gerding, SustAI director, said: "Environmental sustainability is one of the greatest challenges our world is facing - and many countries are setting ambitious targets to reduce emissions and increase renewable energy production.
"AI will be key to achieving these targets and, through SustAI, we will nurture the next generation of engineers and technologists who will be trained to create a sustainable future using AI."
The investment was announced ahead of this week's AI safety summit, held at Bletchley Park, looking at the risks posed by the technology.
The funding includes £8m from the government's UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) department.
UKRI chief executive Professor Dame Ottoline Leyser said the UK was in a strong position to harness the power of AI.
She added: "Crucial to this endeavour is nurturing the talented people and teams we need to apply AI to a broad spectrum of challenges, from healthy aging to sustainable agriculture, ensuring its responsible and trustworthy adoption."
