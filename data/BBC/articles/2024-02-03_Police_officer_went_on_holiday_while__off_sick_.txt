A police officer went on holiday abroad while pretending to be off sick, a misconduct hearing has been told.
Former PC James Asling, who worked for Bedfordshire Police, was caught after a supervisor called him and recognised the international dialling tone.
Mr Asling feigned illness in September 2023 after he had his leave request formally refused twice.
A special case hearing on 31 January found he would have been dismissed if he had not already resigned.
He was found to have breached the standards of professional behaviour for honesty and integrity and orders and instructions.
The police officer initially denied leaving the country but later admitted he had gone on holiday.
Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said Mr Asling would be placed on the College of Policing barred list, which would ban him from returning to policing.
"James Asling's actions would have undoubtedly left resourcing pressures, impacting public services and his colleagues," he said.
"In my view, this was a calculated course of action which falls far below the standards I expect, and that are of paramount importance for a police officer."
