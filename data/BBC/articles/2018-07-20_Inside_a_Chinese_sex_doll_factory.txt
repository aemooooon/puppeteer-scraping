The cavernous warehouses in TV series Westworld are filled with fleshy, realistic, AI-powered humanoids that are manufactured en masse.
Now there’s a company in China doing something eerily similar… but building people-sized dolls for a specific purpose: sex.
Baked in body-shaped moulds and strung on row after row of storage hangers, these talking dolls are built to carve out a slice of China’s rapidly growing sex toy industry.
They may not come close to Westworld-like intelligence, but the sheer volume of these robots hint at a growing industry and changing attitudes towards sexuality.
