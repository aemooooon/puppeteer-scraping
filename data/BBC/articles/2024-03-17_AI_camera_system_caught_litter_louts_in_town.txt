A camera that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to spot litter louts led to a reduction in rubbish being dumped on a busy Leicestershire road.
But despite the success of the 12-week trial of Litter Cam in Loughborough, Charnwood Borough Council has no plans to install the devices permanently.
The technology was deployed on the town's busy Warwick Way at the end of last year.
It was designed to work alongside automatic number plate recognition.
As a result of the trial, a total of 28 Â£150 fines were issued.
A council spokesperson said: "During this period, there was a 37% decrease in the amount of litter dropped in that area, and 28 fines have been issued and paid or in the process of payment, appeal, or debt collection.
"Even though the trial has been a success, there are no immediate plans to permanently install litter cams.
"However, it might be something the council considers in the future."
