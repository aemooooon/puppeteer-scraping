A council says a new scheme to repair more hazardous potholes has drastically reduced its compensation bill for trips and falls.
The amount Blackpool Council has paid out has fallen from £1.6m in 2008/09 to £719 last year thanks to a project using AI to identify the worst spots.
The new approach has since been adopted by other councils across the country. 
Labour councillor and cabinet member Paula Burdess said the changes had led to a "huge reduction" in pay-outs.
Officials said about 95% of claims are now successfully defended in a report given to the authority.
The turnaround has been achieved through an AI system that takes satellite images of roads to detect potholes and compiling data on areas most in need of repair.
Ms Burdess told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: "The investment strategy and programme ensures that the network works and is safe.
"Project Amber was established in 2019 to involve small and medium-sized businesses in the maintenance process, aiming to provide the right treatment at the right time, in the right place."
The success of the scheme also means the council receives the top level of government funding for its highways budget.
