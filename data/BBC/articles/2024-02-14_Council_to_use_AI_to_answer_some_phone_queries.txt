A council will begin using artificial intelligence (AI) to help answer residentsâ€™ queries over the phone. 
Breckland Council in Norfolk said "Bobbie, the Phone Bot" would initially provide information on council tax issues but would be expanded to include housing, business support and planning matters by the end of the year.
The Conservative-run council said it would enable customer service call handlers to "focus on more complex cases" during normal office hours.
Harry Clarke, leader of the opposition Labour Group, said he would monitor the new service to ensure it worked effectively.
AI allows computers to learn and solve problems.
The council said it first started using Bobbie technology last year when it began answering questions through the council's website.
It claimed that in 85% of cases, Bobbie was able to resolve a queries without having to refer them for further help.
It described the technology as "a great success".
Mr Clarke, a ward councillor in Dereham, said: "Any innovation is to be commended, especially if it helps to make us spend our money more wisely, but it's important that people can still speak to a person when they need to connect with a specialist officer or department. 
"I will be looking personally for feedback from residents to make sure this system is working effectively and giving people the right information in a timely way."
The service, which will be available 24-hours of the day, will begin on 21 February.
