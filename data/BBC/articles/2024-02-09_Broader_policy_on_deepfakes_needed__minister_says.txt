A broader policy is needed alongside new sexual offences laws to protect from deepfakes, the Justice and Home Affairs minister has said. 
It comes as the Sexual Offences and Obscene Publications Act 2021 is due to come into force on the Isle of Man next month. 
Jane Poole-Wilson said while it included protections against deepfakes, a "broader policy" was still needed.
She said regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) was an issue "challenging many governments around the globe".
Deepfakes are a type of AI technology that swaps or digitally alters faces in videos and images. 
Ms Poole-Wilson told the House of Keys progress had been made "to protect the island against such threats" but there was a need for broader reaching policies to "address the threats and opportunities artificial intelligence brings".
Ms Poole-Wilson said the forthcoming new laws introduced offences relating to "the distribution of intimate images, including altered images, without consent", which would include deepfakes.
It also contained provisions to deal with revenge porn, she said.
The minister said a new law was being considered in the UK "that would mandate the labelling of all artificial intelligence generated photos and videos to counter AI deepfakes", which the department was monitoring  to gauge whether the island "would benefit" from such a law.
Alex Allinson MHK said the sharing of intimate pictures of people "whether they be artificially generated or manipulated or not" was a "form of abuse" that could have long-term effects on those people.
Welcoming the forthcoming legislation, he said it was important people knew circulating pictures online would  "be dealt with by the courts".
David Ashford asked whether actions being taken around the world were being considered so the island did not sit "behind the curve".
Ms Poole-Wilson said her department would constantly review moves in other jurisdictions to stay "abreast of any potential risks".
