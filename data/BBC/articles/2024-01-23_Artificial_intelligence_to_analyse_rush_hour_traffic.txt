A new scheme that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to try to improve traffic flow in Hull has begun.
The technology will be used to analyse data gathered during the morning and evening rush hours on main roads in and out of the city.
Computer software is then used to change the sequencing of traffic lights to help keep vehicles moving.
Officials believe it could help to reduce congestion and improve air quality.
The scheme was announced last summer and the technology was used for the first time in December.
Councillor Mark Ieronimo, portfolio holder for roads, highways and transportation at Hull City Council, said: "The public have been really clear [that] congestion and traffic is something they want us to improve.
"Things like journey times really matter and people want better environmental and health outcomes too."
The system is being trialled on County Road, Spring Bank, Cottingham Road, Freetown Way and Anlaby Road.
The trial is due to continue into 2025 and could be rolled out to other parts of the city.
