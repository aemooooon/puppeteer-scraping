Humanity is turning to technology to resurrect lost species and create artificial life, but is it worth it if we can’t protect the natural world we have around us?
A defining trait of the human species has been our tendency to shape our environment and surroundings to suit us. As our technological prowess has increased, so has our ability to transform landscapes and the planet.
Today we can divert entire rivers, reclaim land from the oceans, chop down swathes of forest, level mountainsides and build new ones as we constantly seek to improve the physical world around us.

But it has also become clear that our actions are taking a toll on the health of our planet, in the guise of climate change, the destruction of habitats, the loss of species and pollution.
This has led some to search for ways of turning our ingenuity to the benefit of the planet. Attempts to resurrect species that have gone extinct or use gene-editing technologies to create artificial life are examples of this.
But artist Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg questions whether this is the right thing to do. In an interview with BBC Future at the Dezeen Day 2019, she asks whether we risk losing even more if we focus on trying to make the world “better” rather than simply protecting what remains of the natural world.
