The Natalie Portman film by the director of Ex Machina is about as intelligent as sci-fi film-making today can get, writes Caryn James.
In Alex Garlandâ€™s Annihilation, The Shimmer appears as a lovely, iridescent wall, a gel-like substance of alien origin enclosing a recently evacuated area. It is enticing, poetic and ominous, like this cerebral sci-fi thriller itself, which takes Natalie Portman and four other scientists inside the area to investigate what the Shimmer holds and why all previous missions have disappeared inside it.
Following his sharp focus on artificial intelligence in Ex Machina, Garland has written and directed a film that is broader but scene-for-scene just as masterful. Annihilation is philosophical about human nature and identity, without being in the least pretentious. It addresses the psychology of self-destructive behaviour. And it drops in effective jump-scares. Mutated beasts, including a bear and an enormous white alligator, pounce on the team apparently out of nowhere. Throughout, Garland fills the screen with images that become ever more ravishing as the team gets closer to some answers.
