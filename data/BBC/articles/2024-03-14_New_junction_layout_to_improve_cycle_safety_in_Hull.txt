New road safety measures in Hull will include the city's first CYCLOPS or cycle-optimised protected signals junction, Hull City Council has said.
Last year the authority confirmed the A165 Freetown Way would revert to a dual carriageway with a dedicated cycle lane and footway.
As part of the plan, Blundell's Corner will see pedestrians and cyclists completely separated from motor traffic.
The plans should be finalised in the summer with building work starting in spring 2025.
The scheme will also see footways on both sides of Freetown Way widened.
The junction, which connects Freetown Way to Ferensway, Spring Bank and Beverley Road, is one of the city's busiest and there has been a death at the junction since 2021.
Councillor Mark Ieronimo said the changes will give people "greater choice when it comes to travel options" in the city.
"This scheme not only demonstrates this council’s commitment to providing the facilities needed to encourage more people to choose active and sustainable modes of travel, like cycling, but also to enhancing the city’s highways to make them safer," he added.
In total, £8.75m will be spent on changes to Freetown Way and a second cycle scheme on Preston Road.
