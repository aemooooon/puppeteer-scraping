The robot revolution has yet to take off. Why? Roboticist Rodney Brooks thinks this is because we have to feel we need them in our lives.
In decades past, science fiction writers believed the homes and workplaces of the future would include teams of labour-saving robots who would perform most menial tasks.
Why has this robot revolution not happened? Rethink Robotics chairman and CTO Rodney Brooks says it’s because we need to actually want the robots designers are making – and too often they aren’t asking us.
The Australian-born Brooks says the key is listening to what people want in their robot – and making them easier to interact with.
