Two people have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a teenager was stabbed on Boxing Day, police said.
Bedfordshire Police dispatched officers to Woodcock Road, Luton, at about 03:10 GMT on Tuesday.
The alleged victim, who is in his late teens, was taken to hospital, where he remained in a stable condition.
A 23-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy were arrested and remained in police custody, the force said.
Officers said they want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time or who may have doorbell or dashcam footage.
Det Insp Jon Wheeler from Bedfordshire Police said: "I would urge anyone who can assist us to get in touch immediately to shed some light on the situation.
"Knife crime remains an area of concern and priority across the county, but we are working hard to keep Bedfordshire safe by challenging those that choose to carry weapons and use them to incite fear and harm others."
