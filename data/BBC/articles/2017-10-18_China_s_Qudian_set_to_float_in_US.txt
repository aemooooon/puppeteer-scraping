Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, which runs China's biggest mobile payment platform Alipay, is a principal shareholder in the company.
Qudian's services are closely linked to Ant Financial, as the loans are paid into Alipay accounts and also repaid using Alipay.  
Qudian claims to be an innovator in applying artificial intelligence to financial applications.  
The company uses machine learning and data collected from its customers to assess their credit-worthiness.     
Technology-based financial services are popular in China, where many consumers do not have credit cards and instead use mobile payments.
