Mounted patrol officers have been preparing for an AI summit which will be visited by world leaders.
Riders will be supporting security at the UK government's global Artificial Intelligence (AI) summit at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.
Police horses will patrol near the event which starts on 1 November.
Thames Valley Police said it would also have a drone unit in operation throughout the course of the summit.
Drone pilots on the ground will be using the technology to look out for suspicious activity.
Insp Chris Simpson said: "Our expert mounted section and drone unit are just some of the many additional security measures we have in place to ensure the safety both of delegates to the summit and residents and businesses."
"Our police horses enjoy the attention they get from the public so please do stop and speak with them when you spot them on patrol," he added.
World leaders will meet with AI companies and experts at the summit to try and build an international consensus on the future of AI.
Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of modern computing, cracked the Enigma code - used by Germany's military - with his team during World War Two at Bletchley Park.
