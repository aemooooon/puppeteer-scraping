MPs will decide later whether to back the government's Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes his final bid to make Brexit happen by the end of the month. If they do vote for it, there will be another vote - on whether to approve a three-day timetable for Parliament to consider the legislation.

Yet ministers say they are confident of getting enough support, with Labour rebels and former Tory MPs now sitting as independents ready to back Mr Johnson's deal with the EU. Here's what's in the bill.
"The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I," the prime minister said ahead of the debate. But, writes BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, if MPs reject the government's timetable, the chances of meeting the 31 October deadline "look slim indeed".

For any commuter the prospect of being whisked to and from work in a fraction of the time it usually takes is pretty irresistible. No traffic jams, no train delays and no cold platforms - what's not to love? 
This is the promise of more than a hundred companies developing electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Like helicopters they don't need a runway, but unlike helicopters they promise to be quiet and cheap.
Yet the dream seems to be some way off. Industry experts say that taxi services using such aircraft won't be a mass-market phenomenon until the 2030s. So what is the hold up?
