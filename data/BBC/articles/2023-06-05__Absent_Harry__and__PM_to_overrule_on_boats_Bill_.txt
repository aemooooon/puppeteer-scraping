The front page of the Guardian carries a picture of a Ukrainian soldier in a pick-up truck, making the V for victory sign. The paper says Ukraine appears to be in the "preliminary stages" of its long anticipated counter-offensive. 
The Financial Times talks of a "new phase" in the Ukrainian military operation, while the Daily Telegraph suggests that Kyiv's strategy may be to conduct "shaping operations" - to find weaknesses in Russia's defensive line, before committing more soldiers and weaponry.
The i reports that, contrary to Moscow's claims, pro-Kremlin bloggers have reported that Kyiv's troops made quick gains. The Daily Mail suggests that the aim may be to reveal the locations of Russian long range weaponry, before deploying British Storm Shadow long-range missiles against their ammunition stores. 
Away from Ukraine, the Daily Telegraph says the prime minister has suggested that he's prepared to use the Parliament Act to force his Illegal Migration Bill through, if it's delayed by peers. 
The act allows the Commons to overrule the Lords, but is rarely used. The Telegraph says that during an interview with the paper, Rishi Sunak twice "indicated" that he would be open to using it.
