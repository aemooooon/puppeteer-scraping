Will we one day be able to access all of human knowledge directly from a chip implanted into our brains?
American author, inventor, and futurist Ray Kurzweil believes it will be possible.
He argues that the exponential rise in computing power we see today will continue to a point where in 2029, machines will be as smart as people.
At that point, he says, people will inevitably begin to use technology in new ways, implanting powerful devices that augment our abilities.
Kurzweil calls this point in time “the singularity”.
At the recent Singularity Summit in San Francisco, he told BBC Future how this momentous change will come about and what it will mean for us and society.
