A university has submitted plans for a "state-of-the-art" anatomy centre.
The University of East Anglia (UEA) said its existing anatomy suite - within the Queen's Building - has been in operation for more than 20 years.
UEA said a new facility, which it hopes to open in April 2025, would offer "increased capacity for teaching" at undergraduate, postgraduate and specialist training levels.
If approved, it will be built as an extension to the Edith Cavell Building.
UEA said the new anatomy suite would provide "flexibility to react to technological changes in teaching methods," and "be compliant with essential updates to health and safety legislation and embalming methods".
The new facility will provide an anatomy teaching space, seminar rooms and "improved preparation areas for both staff and students and associated storage and academic office facilities".
UEA said it would offer "significantly more and desperately needed space for innovative teaching and practical skills development supporting growth in the NHS workforce."
The development will be supported by a successful grant application of £5.7m supported by regulator the Office for Students.
UEA's Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences pro-vice chancellor Charles ffrench-Constant, said: "Our anatomy teaching facilities have been at the heart of our healthcare student training for two decades.
"It's now wonderful to be able to fully modernise this vital part of our buildings to increase the number of students we can train and provide them with state-of-the-art facilities." 
Subject to planning permission, work is expected to begin in May 2024.
