Ipswich has been awarded "Heritage Harbour" status in recognition of its historical significance.
The use of the port can be dated back to the 7th Century and became the largest wet dock in Britain in 1842.
It is one of 12 harbours and inland ports, including Wells next the sea in Norfolk and Maldon and Heybridge in Essex, to be awarded the status.
The award highlighted "Ipswich's timeless legacy" said port operator Associated British Ports (ABP).
Heritage Harbour status is awarded by the National Working Group of Heritage Harbours, which is supported by the Maritime Heritage Trust, National Historic Ships UK and Historic England. 
The port of Ipswich is owned and operated by Associated British Ports (ABP) and is the UK's leading agricultural export port, handling more than two million tonnes of cargo a year .
The chairman of Ipswich Maritime Trust, Ben Good, said: "We are thrilled that Ipswich's importance as a trading port since the seventh century, and the wharves and warehouses that can be seen today along the historic Waterfront, have been acknowledged in this international accolade."
The trust has various plans to show off the port's heritage through its buildings, boats and artefacts as well as through running youth and events programmes. 
Paul Ager, ABP's Divisional Port Manager, said: "Receiving the prestigious Heritage Harbour status celebrates Ipswich's timeless legacy as one of the oldest trading ports in the UK. 
"This recognition, coupled with the port's consistent ranking as the number one export port for agricultural products, highlights ABP's enduring commitment to maritime excellence."
He described the port as "a trailblazer" which integrated drone and artificial intelligence technology into port operations.
