A new course in artificial intelligence (AI) at Barnsley College will help educate people about how the technology can help them at work, its leader has said.
The course, which lasts 10 weeks, is due to start in March. 
Danny Wright, from Barnsley College, said AI could be used to assist people in the workplace, rather than replace them.
He said the course would show people how the technology could help with menial everyday tasks.
Speaking to BBC Radio Sheffield, Mr Wright said:  "It's about using AI as a tool to enhance either what you already do, or the work you want to go into."
He said it should be seen as something to help, rather than hinder, workers.
"Rather than seeing it as something we don't yet understand, or thinking it's like what we see in science-fiction, where it does all the jobs for us without our input."
He said AI can be used to help with regular tasks, such as writing emails and formatting documents.
"We need to be looking at this from a viewpoint of it supporting with the jobs we've got," he added.
"People are being given more tasks to do on a daily basis in jobs that are demanding more and more from them.
"10 to 15 years down the line as it gets smarter and it learns from what we do, that's maybe when we'll see certain job roles fade out."
The Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course is designed to "empower and educate students of all backgrounds", Mr Wright added.
