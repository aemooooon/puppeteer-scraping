Mobile giant Samsung is donating 2,000 smartphones to the NHS, for staff to use in Nightingale hospitals.
It will provide Galaxy XCover 4s phones, which are designed to be more robust and can be used while wearing gloves.
Samsung said NHS England had already ordered an extra 20,000 phones and tablets, which it had agreed to supply at cost price, without taking a profit.
Facebook is also donating 2,050 of its Portal video-calling screens.
The Portals are designed to enhance video chats by using artificial intelligence to keep callers in view as they move about a room, making it easier to go about daily activities while continuing a conversation.
Facebook said it would send the devices to hospitals and care homes in several locations including Essex, London, Manchester, Newcastle and Surrey. 
NHS England will be allowed to keep the kit without charge once the pandemic ends.
"Technology companies big and small continue to pledge their resources and expertise to support our NHS and social care system in these unprecedented times," said NHSX digital transformation director Iain O'Neil.
"Technology has never been so important to providing one of life's most essential things - the ability to communicate with the people we love regardless of where they are."
