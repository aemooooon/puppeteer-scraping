Many of the front pages feature a smiling photograph of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, who died in Solihull last year after a catalogue of abuse by his father and stepmother. 
The Mirror describes Emma Tustin and Thomas Hughes, who are due to be sentenced later today for murder and manslaughter respectively, as "beyond evil". 
The Daily Telegraph quotes a prosecutor, who said the little boy had a "bruise for every day of lockdown". 
The Mail says social workers, police and teachers face "damning questions" over missed opportunities to stop the child's death. 
The paper asks "Why didn't they save Arthur?". The Sun has a similar take, with the headline "Did they learn nothing from Baby P?" . The paper compares the tragic case to that of Peter Connelly, who died in London in 2007 after suffering more than 50 injuries.
The Guardian reports that the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has been dealt a blow by the party's biggest funder. 
The Unite union decided to cut its political donations. In an exclusive interview to mark her first 100 days in the job, the organisation's new general secretary, Sharon Graham, said Unite would still pay £1m in affiliation fees to Labour, but that other money would be better spent on union campaigns. 
The Financial Times reports that Saudi Arabia has agreed to keep increasing monthly crude oil production, after a "charm offensive" by the United States, where prices at fuel pumps have soared. 
The paper says a high-level American delegation held talks in the kingdom this week, signalling a shift in Washington's approach to relations with Riyadh.

"Jab results boost hopes of beating Omicron" is the upbeat headline on the front of the Times. The paper reports on the outcome of the British trial, which it says "underpins" the decision to press ahead with a mass Covid booster campaign. 
But the i newspaper is concerned that a sharp drop in the number of people using the NHS Covid app could leave an opening in the UK's armour against the new variant. 
It points to health service data, which shows that far fewer people are being "pinged" now than they were in the summer, despite infection rates remaining at high levels.
The Metro reports that a crackdown on passengers failing to wear masks on public transport in London saw 152 people fined £200 in one day. It says another 125 were "kicked off" the city's Tube, bus and rail network for refusing to follow the new rules, which came into force in England this week.
The Mirror complains of "chaos and confusion" after ministers appeared to give conflicting advice about whether parties should be going ahead this festive season. "Make your mind up on Christmas" is the paper's plea. 
The Daily Express, meanwhile, is happy to go with the prime minister's view that people shouldn't be cancelling any plans. "Boris blasts bah humbug cancel Xmas brigade" is the headline there.
