The world's top Go player will take on an artificial intelligence opponent again this spring, but this time it will not be Google's DeepMind that provides the machine rival.
Ke Jie had previously vowed never to play against AI again after repeatedly losing to DeepMind's AlphaGo.
But according to Chinese media reports, he will take on a range AI opponents, including one from China's Tencent.
The man-versus-machine series will take place in China in April 2018.
Other firms providing AI programs include Japan's DeepZenGo and Taiwan's CGI. The matches will form part of the the World AI Go Tournament.

A South Korean Go champion, Lee Sedol, had already played DeepMind in March 2016. He lost 4-1, in a series of matches described by experts as a landmark achievement for AI.
