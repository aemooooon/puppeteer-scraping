AUT researchers asked five New Zealand-based advertising agencies to consider the impact of AI-generated images on their creative processes. Focus groups from large and boutique ad agencies were shown AI-created 'blended' animal images created from text prompts, for a VW ad campaign called "small but ferocious".  They were asked to consider AI's impact on aesthetics, the creative practice, and the relative merits of human vs machine capabilities.
