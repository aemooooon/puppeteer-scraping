Renowned computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton quit his role at Google last year.
When he resigned, he said he was able to speak freely about what the dangers of be, and that some were "quite scary".
In particular, around how AI could spread misinformation, upend the job market, and ultimately, pose an existential risk to humanity.
Dr Hinton was an early pioneer of the neural network - a method which teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
It's that network which morphed into AI, which is advancing so quickly that this week European Union lawmakers approved new regulations around it.
Meanwhile, the Government here has indicated it will draw up a framework.
