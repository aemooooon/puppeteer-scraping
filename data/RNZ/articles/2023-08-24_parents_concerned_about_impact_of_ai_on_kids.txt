AI is "another element" for parents already worried that their kids might be addicted to screens, says Norton systems engineer Dean Williams.
ChatGPT - the AI language tool that has captured the world - can either aid or hinder their schoolwork, he says. And alongside inappropriate content, cyberbullying and grooming, it's yet another pitfall for kids who are online without adequate supervision.
Williams recommends looking after young people "take charge" of their online behaviour via parental controls and educational conversations.
"Parents need to be the frontline of defence. Understand what your kids are doing online and how they're using devices. Educate them about some of the risks. We don't want them to stop going online but we want them to be safe at the same time."
1,020 New Zealand adults participated in the 2023 Norton Cyber Safety omnibus survey, conducted online by Dynata on behalf of Gen.
