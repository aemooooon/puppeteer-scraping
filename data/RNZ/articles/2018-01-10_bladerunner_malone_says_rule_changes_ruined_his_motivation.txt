Malone has announced his retirement to focus on a role in the high-tech business sector.
The 24 year old won two golds and a silver at the 2016 Rio Paralympics.
Malone said the changes would mean he would have to start from scratch.
"There's been some changes to the Paralympics regarding the rules for the blades that we run on. That's really going to change everything basically and I sort of looked at how that would impact the sport and my competitive stance within it and it really put me in an ambivalent state and I don't think that's a good way to be. I didn't want to spend the next two years training for the World Champs in a state of ambivalence.
"They changed the algorithms which determines factors with the blades and what you can use and basically it would feeling like starting from square one again."
The Nelson-raised athlete said he ultimately lacked motivation to continue in the sport at the highest level.
"Becoming an elite athlete was an incredible journey but life is short, I want to find something that I can commit to and be happy in for a long time.
"It would be unjust to commit half-heartedly to those who support me, my coach, the supporting organisations, the New Zealand public, sponsors, my friends and family."
Malone said his career highlight was winning Olympic gold in Rio on the day that would have been his mother's birthday in New Zealand.
His mum died following a battle with bowel cancer in 2012.
Athletics NZ said Malone has taken a role with tech company Soul Machines which does artificial intelligence research to push what is possible in human computing.
