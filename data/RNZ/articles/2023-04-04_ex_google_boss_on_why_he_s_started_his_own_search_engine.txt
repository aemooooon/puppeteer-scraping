Neeva uses artificial intelligence to power about half of its searches, and keeps the experience ad-free through a subscription model. 
Its launch in New Zealand comes amid debate about the speed AI is being deployed - last week a group of computer scientist, researchers and industry notables came out in support of a 6-month hiatus to AI development.
One of Neeva's co-founders, Sridhar Ramaswamy spent 15 years at Google, rising to become senior Vice President of Ads and Commerce, before becoming disillusioned with the company.
