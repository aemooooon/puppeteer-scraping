Tech Users Association (TUANZ) chief executive Craig Young said the recent Tech Users Summit 2023 set out the challenges to be addressed, which would affect all individuals and businesses.
He said everyone needed to have unrestricted access to the technology and services required to thrive in a digital world.
"If we wait for the digital future to come us than we won't make the most of it," Young said, adding that connectivity, artificial intelligence and security issues were a priority.
He said a growing skills shortage was another issue, which could be addressed by training people at a younger age as well as tweaks to immigration settings.
"I think the government needs to move very quickly around guard-rails, particularly for artificial intelligence," Young said.
"We have to think very carefully about moving quickly, and putting things in place to make sure that we make the most of that technology, but we also do it in the right way."
