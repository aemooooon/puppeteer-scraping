Treasury said the tax take was more than $2b above expectations, with increases in company, income and GST revenue.
However, it said some of the increase may only be temporary because it included payment of taxes from previous years and IRD's new monthly payments system was still bedding in.

Net debt was better than expected at 21.2 percent of GDP.
The surplus for the year ending June is expected to be just under $3.5b.
