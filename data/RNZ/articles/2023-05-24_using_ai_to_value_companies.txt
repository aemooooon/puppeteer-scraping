A research team at the University of Auckland has successfully used artificial intelligence to evaluate the actual value of companies. 
The data used is based on profitability, efficiency, growth, risk and other factors, and the research has recently been published in a leading global accounting journal.
It shows that machine learning algorithms can provide very accurate stock valuations, often more accurate than traditional methods.
