The annual research commissioned by InternetNZ surveyed just over 1000 people online on their awareness, feelings, and concerns about the developing technology.
It showed 72 percent of people were concerned it would be used for malicious purposes and without regulation.
A total of 42 percent of those surveyed said they were more concerned than excited about it, with 11 percent feeling more excited than concerned.
InternetNZ chief executive Vivien Maidaborn said the internet evolved at a rate that could be hard to keep up with, and it would keep presenting new challenges, like AI.
"We need our government to be thinking about what guidelines, policies, and laws are required to keep us on the cutting edge."
The research also found the majority of New Zealanders admitted to not knowing a lot about AI, with 63 percent having said they only know 'a little' and 13 percent indicated they know nothing at all.
Maidaborn thought it was not surprising that there was fear around the technology.
"We're new to understanding what AI is and what it really means for us.
"The level of concern that New Zealanders are expressing is a responsible and reasonable reaction."
The report was done by research company Verian and also surveyed New Zealanders on a range of other internet-related questions.
It found more than a quarter of New Zealanders spend five hours or more on the internet for personal use and that 80 percent think the positives of the internet outweighed the negatives.
