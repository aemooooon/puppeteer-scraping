At a tourism conference in Napier, Ikaroa-Tair훮whiti MP Meka Whaitiri said finding ways to encouraging more off-season and regional travel was a key priority for the government.
Tourism hotspots are struggling to cope with growth, especially during the peak summer season, and with international visitor numbers forecast to hit 5.1 million by 2024 there were concerns at how the industry might cope.
The answer may be in offering more personalised, authenthic and cultural experiences in smaller towns, with M훮ori tourism picked to be a big growth area, Tourism Export Council chief executive Judy Chen said.
"People are travelling in smaller groups, wanting more authentic experiences ... and really wanting to connect with locals. A lot of our upcomming products are M훮ori products, telling their story, their family and history."
One business already benefiting from this trend was Napier M훮ori Tours.
Owner Hinewai Hawaikirangi said they had grown 70 percent in its first year and were attracting tourists from Germany, Netherlands, Japan and China.
"Our tours involve hunting and gathering. We set the net, we bring it in and process and we have this magnificent fresh seafood feast, which you can't really get anywhere else in the world."
These new travellers did not just want to experience these niche attractions, they must also be pretty enough to feature on social media, Callahan Innovation's Jesse Keith said.
"This shows how much the face of travel has changed ... more than 40 percent of those under 33 prioritise the 'instagram-ability' of a location. People are literally trolling through Instagram figuring out where they are going to go."
