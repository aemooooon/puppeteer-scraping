Dr David Squirrell and his team at Toku Eyes have developed artificial intelligence software to help screen for diabetic retinopathy and prevent visual impairment and irreversible sight loss.
Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults, but 40 percent of diabetic patients in New Zealand are still not being screened for diabetic retinopathy.
Toku Eyes hopes to encourage more people to get screened by making the process faster, more accessible, and even more accurate.
