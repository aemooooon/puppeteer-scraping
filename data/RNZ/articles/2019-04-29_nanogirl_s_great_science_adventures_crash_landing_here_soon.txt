Find out the answer to these and heaps of other super interesting science questions with Nanogirl and her nanobot - the Constantly Learning Artificial Intelligence Repository - aka CLAIR.
Each week, Nanogirl travels the country on her trusty - or is that rusty - Jetvolt. She'll take you along for the rollercoaster ride and hopefully answer a burning science question on the way.
Listen out for a fun experiment every episode - which you'll be able to try at home. 
We'd love to hear how they go - so email your results and any fun science questions you might have to the team at scienceadventures@rnz.co.nz.
Nanogirl's great science adventures crash landing here and where ever you listen to podcasts on Friday 10 May, 2019.
