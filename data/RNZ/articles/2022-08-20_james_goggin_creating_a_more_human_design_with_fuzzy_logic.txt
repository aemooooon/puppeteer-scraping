Graphic designer James Goggin has been revisiting Fuzzy Logic, an intentionally imprecise computational theory first conceived back in 1965. Application of the theory can be seen today in everything from speech recognition software to the microwave reheat button. 
Goggin is interested in how a ‘new fuzzy logic’ might inject humanity into all manner of design. One of his most recent projects is Ubi Sunt, a diaristic Covid-times meta-novella designed  in collaboration with the author, Google AI researcher Blaise Agüera y Arcas. You can view it here.
